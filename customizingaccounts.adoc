= Customizing Accounts
:toc:

This chapter describes the features and user preferences that can be configured for an account, either from the assigned COS or in an individual account.

[NOTE]
Mailbox features are enabled for {product-short} {web-client} users.
When IMAP or POP clients are used, users might not have these features available.

[IMPORTANT]
Some features mentioned in the following sections may not be currently available for the {modern-client}. 

== Messaging and Collaboration Applications

Your COS configuration and assignment of a COS to accounts determines the default settings for account features and the restrictions to be applied to groups of accounts.
Individual accounts can be configured differently, and any changes you make override the COS setting.
When you update the COS, the changes are not reflected in accounts that have COS overrides.

=== Email Messaging Features

You configure which email messaging features are enabled.
Users can then manage many of the enabled features as preferences.

By default, users manage their own preferences, but you can administratively elect not to allow user modifications to their account preferences.
Currently supported {web-app-term} Email Messaging Features are listed and described in <<table_email_features,Email Features>>.
