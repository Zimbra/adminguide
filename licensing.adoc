|=======================================================================

== License Activation

All {product-name} {product-version} installations require license activation.
New installations have a 10 day grace period from the license issue date before requiring activation.
You can activate your license in the Administration Console.

Admin Console: ::
*Home -> Configure -> Global Settings -> License*, from the *Gear* icon select *Activate License*

You can also activate your license from the command line interface.

IMPORTANT: Upgraded {product-name} versions require an immediate activation to maintain network feature functionality.

=== Automatic License Activation

Licenses are automatically activated if the {product-name} server has a connection to the Internet and can communicate with the {product-short} License server.
If you are unable to activate your license this way, see the next section on <<Manual_License_Activation,Manual License Activation>>.

[[Manual_License_Activation]]
=== Manual License Activation

For systems that do not have external access to the {product-short} License server, you can use the {product-short} Support Portal to activate your license manually.

Go to the {product-provider} website at https://www.zimbra.com and click on *Support* to display the {product-short} Technical Support page.
Click on the *Support Portal Login* button to display the {product-short} Support Portal page.
Enter your email and password to log in.

If you have problems accessing the Support Portal, contact Zimbra Sales at sales@zimbra.com or by calling 1-972-407-0688.688.

=== When Licenses are not Installed or Activated

If you fail to install or activate your {product-name} server license, the following scenarios describe the impact on your {product-name} server.

[cols="25,75",options="header",grid="rows"]
|=======================================================================
|License Condition |Description/Impact

|Not installed |
With no installed license, the {product-name} server defaults to single user mode where all license-limited features are limited to one user.

|Not valid |
If the license file appears forged or fails validation for other reasons, the {product-name} server defaults to single-user mode.

|Not activated |
A license activation grace period is 10 days.
If this period passes without activation, the {product-name} server defaults to single-user mode.

|For future date |
If the license starting date is in the future, the {product-name} server defaults to single-user mode.

|In grace period |
If the license ending date has passed and is within the 30 day grace period, all license-limited features are still enabled, but administrators may see license renewal prompts.

| Expired |
{product-short} does not include a FOSS binary release; therefore, there is no mechanism to fallback to FOSS. If the license ending date has passed, the 30 day grace period has expired, and users decide *not* to obtain a new license, they can resolve these issues by building the {product-short} binaries and installing them on top of their existing {product-short} system.

|=======================================================================

== Obtain a License

Go to the {product-provider} Website https://www.zimbra.com to obtain a trial license from the Network Downloads area.
Contact {product-provider} sales regarding a trial extended license, or to purchase a subscription license or perpetual license, by emailing sales@zimbra.com or calling 1-972-407-0688.

A subscription or perpetual license can only install on the {product-name} system identified during purchase.
Only one {product-short} license is required for your {product-name} environment.
This license sets the maximum number of accounts on the system.

View current license information, including the number of purchased accounts, the number of accounts used, and the expiration date, in the Admin Console.

Admin Console: ::
*Home -> Configure -> Global Settings -> License*.

== Managing Licenses

=== License Expiration

When your {product-name} {product-version} License expires, a license expiration warning appears in the administrative console and web interface for all users.
From the date of the license expiration, there is a 30-day grace period during which the administrator sees the warning message, but no features are disabled.

{product-short} does not include a FOSS binary release; therefore, there is no mechanism to fallback to FOSS. If the license ending date has passed, the 30 day grace period has expired, and users decide *not* to obtain a new license, they can resolve these issues by building the {product-short} binaries and installing them on top of their existing {product-short} system.

=== Renewal

If you exhaust your licensed user limit, you are no longer able to create accounts.
You can buy additional user licenses, or you can delete existing accounts.
Contact Zimbra sales to purchase additional licenses.

You must renew your license within 30 days of the expiration date.
Starting 30 days before the license expires, when you log on to the Administration Console, a reminder notice is displayed.

== Updating Your License

When you renew or change the Zimbra license, you update {product-name} mailbox servers with the new license information.
Perform this operation from either the CLI or the Administration Console.
