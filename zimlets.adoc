:toc:

Zimlets are a mechanism to integrate {product-abbrev} with different third-party
applications to enhance the user experience from the Zimbra Web Client.
With Zimlets, users can look at information and interact with the
third-party application from within their email messages. Zimlets can be
made available from the Zimbra Web Client Overview Pane to users by
modifying the Class of Service (COS).

{product-abbrev} includes several predefined Zimlets. You can also create Zimlets or
download them from the Zimlet Gallery located on the Zimbra Web site.

Predefined Zimlets when enabled let users preview the following:

* Mouse over a date or time and see what is in calendar.

* Mouse over a name or email address and see details from the address book
for this name.

* Right-click on a phone number to make a call with your soft-phone.

* Right-click on a date to schedule a meeting.

* Right-click on a name, address, or phone number to update address book
information.

For information about creating Zimlets, see the Zimlet Development section
on the Zimbra Wiki.

== Managing Zimlets from the Administration Console

The following Zimlet management tasks are available from the Zimbra
Administration Console.

* Deploy a Zimlet, which creates the Zimlet entry in the LDAP server,
installs the Zimlet files on the server, enables the Zimlet and makes it
available to the members of the default COS.

* Make a Zimlet available or not available per COS or account.

* Make a Zimlet mandatory.

* Disable a Zimlet, which leaves it on the server, but the Zimlet is not
used.

* Undeploy a Zimlet, which removes it from the COS listings and the Zimlets
list but does not uninstall the Zimlet from the server.

[NOTE]
You cannot uninstall the Zimlet from the Administration Console.

=== Deploying Custom Zimlets

You can download and deploy custom Zimlets from the Zimlet Gallery located
on the Zimbra Web site. When a Zimlet is deployed, it is available
immediately to everyone in the default COS. If a Zimlet is not deployed to
another COS directly, the COS displays the Zimlets but they are not
enabled.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Zimlets*, from the *Gear* icon select *Deploy*

// divide definition above from list below
. Browse to the Zimlet you want to deploy, then click *Deploy*.
+
The Zimlet deploys to the server. A dialog displays indicating the server
name where the Zimlet is deployed and the status of the deployment.

. Click *Finish*.
+
Verify the Zimlet is enabled by viewing the Zimlets page.

=== Enable, Disable, or Make Zimlets Mandatory

You can enable, disable, or make Zimlets mandatory. You can also use
the toggle feature to choose if an installed Zimlet will be made
available for users to choose from.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Class of Service -> _COS_ -> Zimlets*

.Zimlet Operational Status Settings.
[cols="1,4",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Description

|Mandatory |
Zimlet will always be enabled in user accounts. Users do not see these
Zimlets on their Zimlet page.

|Disabled |
Zimlet will not be immediately available to users in the associated COS.

|Enabled |
All deployed Zimlets will be enabled.

|=======================================================================

[NOTE]
Users can enable or disable optional Zimlets from their account’s
*Preferences > Zimlets* page. If you select a Zimlet as mandatory, it
cannot be disabled by the user.

=== Undeploying a Zimlet

When a Zimlet is undeployed, it is removed from all COSs and then removed
from the LDAP.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Zimlets*

. Select a _Zimlet_ to undeploy.
. From the *Gear* icon menu select *Undeploy*.
. Click *Yes* to confirm.

=== Adding Proxy-Allowed Domains to a Zimlet

Proxy Allowed Domains lets you configure which external domains can be
accessed through a Zimlet. For the Zimlets that are included in {product-abbrev}, proxy
allowed domains are already configured. If you download and deploy other
Zimlets, you can add additional proxy domain names.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Class of Service*

. Select the _COS_ to edit.

. In the *Advanced* page, scroll down to the *Proxy Allowed Domains*
section.

. Click *Add Domain* to add domains.

. Click *Save*.

=== Upgrading a Zimlet

Use the same steps as deploying a new Zimlet to upgrade a customized
Zimlet. The new Zimlet zip file should have the same name as the existing
Zimlet zip file.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Zimlets*, from the *Gear* icon select *Deploy*

. Check *Flush Zimlet cache,* so that the upgraded zimlet will be used.
. Browse to the _Zimlet_ you want to upgrade, then click *Deploy*.
. Click *Finish*.

== Managing Zimlets from the Command Line Interface

The following Zimlet management tasks are available from the command line
interface.

=== Deploying Zimlets

When a Zimlet is deployed, it is available immediately to everyone in
the default COS. If a Zimlet is not deployed to another COS directly,
the COS displays the Zimlets but they are not enabled.

Deploy a Zimlet using the CLI, including modifying the COS before
deploying.

. Select a Zimlet and copy the Zimlet zip file to `/tmp` folder on your
Zimbra server.

. Login as the zimbra user `su - zimbra`

. Deploy the Zimlet
+
[source,bash]
----
zmzimletctl deploy /tmp/<zimlet>.zip
----

=== Adding Proxy Allowed Domains to a Zimlet

When deploying a Zimlet, the COS attributes, `zimbraProxyAllowedDomains`,
must be set for the domain address that the Zimlet might call to get
information.

To set the `zimbraProxyAllowedDomains` attribute, type:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mc <COSname> +zimbraProxyAllowedDomains '*.example.com'
----

The `*` must be added before the `example.com`.

This must be applied to all COSs that have your Zimlet enabled.

=== Deploying a Zimlet and Granting Access to a COS

Use steps in this section to deploy a Zimlet to one or more COSs other than
the default:

. Login as zimbra user: su – zimbra
. Copy the Zimlet file from Gallery to */tmp* folder.
. Install the Zimlet to the default COS:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmzimletctl deploy /tmp/<zimlet>.zip
----

. To deploy the zimlet to additional COSs, run:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmzimletctl acl <zimletname> <cosname1> grant
----
+
This will grant permission to `cosname1`. You can also grant access to more
than one COS on the same command line:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmzimletctl acl <zimletname> <cosname1> grant <cosname2> grant
----

. To allow this zimlet to use the allowed proxy domains, run the following
on each COS and add the allowed domains.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mc <COSname1> +zimbraProxyAllowedDomains '*.example.com'
zmprov mc <COSname2> +zimbraProxyAllowedDomains '*.example.com'
----

=== Viewing Installed Zimlets

Use the `zmzimletctl` command to view currently installed zimlets:

[source,bash]
----
zmzimletctl listZimlets all
----

The output from this command displays the Zimlets installed on the server,
installed in LDAP, and those available by COS.

=== Changing Zimlet Configurations

Some Zimlets may require additional configuration after they are deployed.

The Zimlet configuration template allows you to make changes on the
configuration template and then install the new configuration file on the
Zimbra server.

Use steps in this section to change a Zimlet configuration:

. Extract the configuration template:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmzimletctl getConfigTemplate <zimlet.zip>
----

. Make the required changes in the template, taking care to change only the
required areas, then save the file.
+
[NOTE]
If you have more than one custom Zimlet, rename the config template.xml
file before updating the configuration in LDAP so that files are not
overwritten.

. Use the zmzimletctl command to update the configuration in the LDAP.  If
you changed the name of the configuration template, replace
`config_template.xml` with the new name.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmzimletctl configure config_template.xml
----

=== Upgrading a Zimlet

Upgrading a customized Zimlet is performed by using the same steps as those
used to deploy a new Zimlet.

[NOTE]
The new Zimlet zip file should be named identically to the existing Zimlet
zip file.

Use steps in this section upgrade a zimlet:

. Copy the Zimlet zip file to the `/opt/zimbra/zimlets-extra` directory,
replacing the older version.

. Deploy the Zimlet
+
[source,bash]
----
zmzimletctl deploy <zimlet.zip file name>
----
+
The Zimlet is copied to the `/opt/zimbra/zimlets-deployed` directory. If
your Zimlet includes a .jsp file, the .jsp file is also copied to the
`/opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimlet/<zimletnamefolder>`.

. To ensure availability of the newer version, flush the cache:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov flushCache zimlet
----

=== Using the Zimbra Gallery

You can download and deploy Zimlets from the Zimlet Gallery located on the
Zimbra web site. Go to https://www.zimbra.org/extend/ and scroll through
the Extensions from the Zimbra Gallery section.
