= Ephemeral Data

There are 3 main types of ephemeral data stored in LDAP during normal operation of {product-name}.

      - Last Logon Time Stamps (`zimbraLastLogonTimestamp`)
      - Auth Tokens (`zimbraAuthTokens`)
      - CSRF Tokens (`zimbraCsrfTokenData`)

On small systems, storage of these types of ephemeral data may be done in the LDAP Server.
However, mail systems with large numbers of active users have been found to overload LDAP for short lived data storage.
Therefore, the preferred option is to store this ephemeral data using an external server.

NOTE: This document does not cover how to install and maintain the ephemeral storage server.

Configuring the storage location of ephemeral data is done through the following LDAP attribute:

|====================
| Attribute | Format | Description
| zimbraEphemeralBackendURL | [backend name]:[params] | Ephemeral Backend URL Configuration
|====================

The two currently supported Ephemeral Data backends are:

|====================
| Backend | Format | Description
| LDAP    | ldap://default |  Default configuration
| SSDB    | ssdb:127.0.0.1:8888 | SSDB server and port
|====================


Frequent authentication requests place a high load on Ephemeral Data storage backend. See the following Zimbra wiki pages for results of authentication-based load tests:

== Configuring a Running {product-name} to Use SSDB

Configuring an already running {product-name} installation
to utilize `SSDB` instead of `LDAP` for short lived data storage is done through the following process:

1. Install `SSDB` and note the ip address and port configured since you will
   need this data for the next steps. Refer to
   <<ssdb-configuration-options.adoc#ssdb_configuration_options>> for more information.
2. Migrate any existing short-lived data to `SSDB` using the `/opt/zimbra/bin/zmmigrateattrs` command.
3. Configure {product-name} to utilize `SSDB`.


== Migration Procedure

1. Access the command prompt on one of the machines in the installation.

[start=2]
. Migrate existing ephemeral data to the `SSDB` backend using the `zmmigrateattrs` utility

----
sudo su - zimbra
/opt/zimbra/bin/zmmigrateattrs ssdb:<ip address|hostname>:port # substituting your server values
----

You may use either an ip address or a hostname for the host portion of the destination URL.
Either way, you will need to ensure it resolves to the proper ip address on all machines in the cluster.
If the provided SSDB address does not resolve to a functioning backend, the migration process will terminate.


[start=3]
. Configure {product-name} to use `SSDB`:

----
sudo su - zimbra
zmprov mcf zimbraEphemeralBackendURL ssdb:<ip address|hostname>:port # substituting your server values
----

As with migration, the host and port must resolve to a functioning SSDB backend. Otherwise,
the value of `zimbraEphemeralBackendURL` will not be changed.


== Migration Details

=== Migration Info

Information about the latest migration process can be viewed by running the command `zmmigrateattrs --status`.
If the migration is currently in progress, this command may have to be run from a new terminal window.
This command will output three pieces of information:

1. The status of the migration: one of IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, or FAILED
2. The URL of the SSDB backend acting as the destination
3. A timestamp of when the migration process was initiated

The migration info can be reset with the command `zmmigrateattrs --clear`. This should only be done if
the status does not reflect the true state of the system.

=== Changing the Ephemeral Backend URL

When the value of `zimbraEphemeralBackendURL` is modified, {product-name} checks the status of the last known migration.
This can result in one of several scenarios:

1. If the migration is completed and the URL of this migration matches the newly provided value, `zimbraEphemeralBackendURL`
is changed to the new value and the migration info is reset. This is the expected use case.
2. If a migration is currently in progress, `zimbraEphemeralBackendURL` will not be changed.
3. If no migration info is available, the migration has failed, or the new URL does not match the migration URL,
`zimbraEphemeralBackendURL` will be changed; however, a warning will be logged stating that data is not guaranteed to have
been migrated.


=== Forwarding Ephemeral Data

During the migration process, and until the backend URL is changed, {product-name} will store new ephemeral data
both in LDAP and `SSDB`; this keeps the two backends from getting out of sync. If the new value of `zimbraEphemeralBackendURL`
is changed to match the migration URL, migration info is reset and the forwarding mechanism is turned off.
If the values do not match, migration info is not reset, and forwarding remains in place.
Note that this means that migration only needs to be run once, even if there is a gap between the initial migration
and URL change. As long as the target backend is never taken offline, it will stay up-to-date. However, if `SSDB` is
taken offline between the end of the migration and the backend URL change, migration will need to be re-run.

These scenarios are demonstrated below:

=== Advanced Migration Options

The `zmmigrateattrs` tool provides several migration options, to be used with careful consideration:

- The `-r` or `--dry-run` option outputs the changes to be made for each account to the console, without actually performing the migration.
- The `-n` or `--num-threads` option specifies how many threads will be used for migration. Omitting this will result in migration happening synchronously.
- The `-a` or `--account` option allows for migration of a comma-separated list of specific accounts. This should be used only for testing or debugging.
- The `-d` or `--debug` option enables debug logging.

If no attribute names are explicitly passed in as arguments, migration will occur for all known ephemeral attributes, as in the example above.

=== Migration Limitations

Ephemeral data migration is a one-way process. The `zmmigrateattrs` script does not support migrating data from `SSDB`
back into LDAP, nor does it support migrating data between different instances of `SSDB`. This means that if the value of
`zimbraEphemeralBackendURL` is reverted back to LDAP after migration, prior authentication data will become inaccessible,
and all user sessions will be invalidated. If migration to a new `SSDB` backend becomes necessary, the data should be
replicated to the new location prior to changing the value of `zimbraEphemeralBackendURL`.

There is one exception to this is: the backend can be safely reverted back to LDAP immediately after the switch to
`SSDB` with minimal loss of data. This is because the original values are retained in LDAP during migration; switching
the backend to `SSDB` leaves a "snapshot" of ephemeral data in LDAP at the time of the switch. The migration utility
does not currently provide a way to delete this data to free up space; however, it allows for the backend to be reverted.
The more time passes between the initial change and the reversion, the less the LDAP snapshot will reflect the true state
of ephemeral data.


=== Changes to zmprov

Due to changes in the way multi-valued ephemeral data is stored, the attributes `zimbraAuthTokens` and `zimbraCsrfTokenData`
are no longer returned as part of the `zmprov ga <account>` response. The value of `zimbraLastLogonTimestamp` is returned
as before, although only if the -l flag is not used, as adding the -l flag will restrict the server to accessing attributes
in LDAP only. It is still possible to modify these attributes using the `zmprov ma <account>` command, regardless of the
ephemeral backend. In order to do this, the provided attribute value must match its LDAP format: `tokenId|expiration|serverVersion`
for auth tokens; `data:crumb:expiration` for CSRF tokens.


=== Migration CSV Output

Each run of `zmmigrateattrs` generates a CSV file in `/opt/zimbra/data/tmp/` directory. The file contains migration info
for every migrated account, such as the number of attributes migrated. Note that it is possible for this to be zero,
which can happen if all ephemeral data for an account is already present in the destination store.

If any migrations fail, a cutdown CSV file report detailing only the errors is also created
in the same directory. The name(s) of the file(s) are logged at the end of the run.


=== Account Deletion Behavior

Ephemeral data deletion behavior differs slightly between SSDB and LDAP backends. With SSDB as the backend, account deletion
results in the `zimbraLastLogonTimestamp` attribute being explicitly deleted from SSDB. `zimbraAuthTokens` and `zimbraCsrfTokenData`,
however, are left to be expired by SSDB when the token lifetimes are reached (default of 2 days). Conversely, ephemeral data
in LDAP is wiped immediately as part of the account deletion process.
