The Legal Intercept feature makes copies of email messages sent, received, or saved as drafts from targeted accounts and sends these messages to a designated "`shadow`" email address.

Legal Intercept can be configured to send the complete content of the message or to send only the header information. When a targeted account sends, receives, or saves a draft message, an intercept message is automatically created to forward copies of the messages as attachments to the specified email address.

== Legal Intercept Settings

The Legal Intercept feature can be configured either for a Class of Service or an individual account.
The feature is configured from the CLI, using `zmprov`.

The only required configuration to set up Legal Intercept is to enable the feature -- `zimbraInterceptAddress` -- on target accounts or COS.

You can enable the attribute `zimbraInterceptSendHeadersOnly` to send only the header information of the email message instead of sending the complete message.

=== Setting Up Legal Intercept

Specify the intercept address to receive intercepted messages.

* If enabling intercept by COS:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mc <cosname> zimbraInterceptAddress <account@intercept.example.com>
----

* If enabling Intercept for an account:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov ma <accountname@example.com> zimbraInterceptAddress <account@intercept.example.com>
----

If you are going to use the default intercept message template and From address (`postmaster@<yourdomain.com>``), a Legal Intercept is set up.

=== Setting Up Legal Intercept to Forward the Message Header

To forward the header information, instead of the complete message for an account:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov ma <accountname@example.com> zimbraInterceptSendHeadersOnly TRUE
----

=== Modifying the Intercept Cover Email Message

An email message is automatically created to forward copies of the intercepted messages as attachments.
The default message includes:

* *From* address is "`postmaster@<yourdomain.com>`"

* *Subject* line "`Intercept message for <account@yourdomain.com>
<interceptedmessage subject>`"

* *Message* "`Intercept message for <account@yourdomain.com>. +
Operation=<type of message>, folder=<foldername>, folder ID=<#>`".

The cover email message can be modified.
Use the following parameters to modify the email message.

[cols="s,",options=""]
|=======================================================================
|ACCOUNT_DOMAIN  |Domain of the account being intercepted.
|ACCOUNT_ADDRESS |Address being intercepted
|MESSAGE_SUBJECT |Subject of the message being intercepted.
|OPERATION       |Operation that the user is performing, "`add message`", "`send message`", or "`save draft`".
|FOLDER_NAME     |Name of the folder to which the message was saved.
|FOLDER_ID       |ID of the folder to which the message was saved.
|NEWLINE         |Used for formatting multi-line message bodies.
|=======================================================================

Use steps in this section to change the from-name, the subject line, or text in the message body:

* To change the *From* name:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov ma <accountname@example.com> zimbraInterceptFrom '<newname@example.com>'
----

* To change the text of the *Subject* line:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov ma <accountname@example.com> zimbraInterceptSubject \
 '<Intercepted message subject text> parameter <text> parameter'
----

* To change the text in the *message body*:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov ma <accountname@example.com> zimbraInterceptBody \
 '<Intercepted message text> parameter <text> parameter'
----

[NOTE]
To modify by COS, type `zmprov mc {cosname} ...`.

== Creating Mailbox Snapshots for Legal Discovery

You can create a query for the user's mailbox using the REST URL format to search for specific types of email messages and attachments and have these messages zipped and saved to your computer.
This `zip` file can be forwarded to a requesting law enforcement agency.

The email message appears as an `.eml` file name after the subject line.
The attachments get saved in the format that they were delivered.

=== Creating a Mailbox Snapshot `zip` File

You must be logged into the {product-short} Administration Console to create the `zip` file. You create a query for one account at a time.

. In the Administration Console address field of the browser, after the port number *7071/*, type:
+
`home/<username>?fmt=zip&query=<searchquerystring>`
+
For example:
+
image::mailbox_snapshot_zip_file.png[Address Bar]
+
In the above example, the search query is requesting a `zip` file of all accounts called `user1`.
+
You can use any search operators supported for searching in {product-short}.
For example, you can search by folder (`in:folder_name`), by sender's name (`from:<someone>`), and you can use multiple search terms. 
See the Search Tips wiki page for keyword examples, https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Search_Tips.

. Press *Enter* or the arrow to create the zip.
A *Confirm* box displays, asking if you want to navigate away from this page.

. Click *OK*.

. Choose where you want to save the `zip` file. 
This `zip` file is ready to be delivered.
