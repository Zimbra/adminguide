= Managing User Accounts
:toc:

== Status of User Accounts

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Manage > Accounts*

The status of an account determines whether a user can log in and
receivemail.  The account status is displayed on the *Accounts*
pane of the Administration Console.

.Status - User Accounts
[cols="1,5",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Status |Description

|Active |
Normal state for mailbox account.  Mail is delivered and users can log in
to the client interface.

|Maintenance |
Logging is disabled and any mail addressed to this account is queued at the
MTA.

Note that this state is automatically set for the account during a backup
or when importing/exporting/ restoring the account.

|Pending |
Assignment for account when it is created but not yet ready to become
active.  While pending, the login is disabled and messages are bounced.

|Locked |
User cannot log in but mail continues to be delivered to the account.  The
locked state can be set if you suspect that a mail account has been
compromised (used in an unauthorized manner).

|Closed |
Login is disabled and messaged are bounced.  This status is used to
soft-delete the account before deleting it from the server.  A closed
acocunt does not change the account license.

|LockOut |
The automatic state that occurs if the user attempts to log in with
incorrect password.  A LockOut cannot be administratively assigned but will
occur after the number of user attempts exceeds the configured number of
attempts allowed.  The duration of the lockout is also configurable.

The administrator can remove the locked out status at any time.

|=======================================================================

== Deleting an Account

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Manage > Accounts*

You can delete accounts from the Administration Console.  This removes
the account from the server, deletes the messages in the message store, and
changes the number of accounts used against your license.

[TIP]
Before you delete an account, run a full backup of that account to save
the account information.  See also <<backup_and_restore,Backup and Restore>>.

== Viewing an Accounts Mailbox

You can view a selected accountâ€™s mailbox content, including all folders,
calendar entries, and tags from the Administration Console.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Manage > Accounts -> _account_*

Select an _account_, from the *Gear* icon select *View Mail*.  The user's
ZWC account opens in a new browser window.

This feature can be used to assist users who are having trouble with
their mail account as you and the account user can be logged on to the
account at the same time.

Any View Mail action to access an account is logged to the `audit.log`
file.

== Using an Email Alias

An email alias is an email address that redirects all mail to a specified
mail account.  An alias is not an email account.  Each account can have
unlimited numbers of aliases.

When you select Aliases from the Manage Aliases navigation pane, all
aliases that are configured are displayed in the content pane.  You can
create an alias, view the account information for a specific alias, move
the alias from one account to another, and delete the alias.

== Working with Distribution Lists

A distribution list is a group of email addresses contained in a list with
a common email address.  When users send to a distribution list, they are
sending the message to everyone whose address is included in the list.  The
address line displays the distribution list address; the individual
recipient addresses cannot be viewed.

You can create distribution lists that require an administrator to manage
the member list and you can create dynamic distribution lists that
automatically manages adding and deleting members in the list.  For more
information about dynamic distribution lists, see
<<using_dynamic_distribution_lists,Using Dynamic Distribution Lists>>.

You can see which distribution lists a user is a member of from the user's
account Member of page.  When a Zimbra user's email address is added to a
distribution list, the user's account Member Of page is updated with the
distribution list name.  When a distribution list is deleted, the
distribution list name is automatically removed from the account's Member
Of page.

=== Setting Subscription Policies for Distribution Lists

Subscription policies can be set up to manage a distribution list's
membership.  Owners of the list manage the subscription policy from the
Properties page of a distribution list.

[cols="1,3a",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Distribution Option |Description

|New Subscription Requests |

* *Automatically accept* -- Membership is open to anyone who subscribes.

* *Require list owner approval* --  To subscribe, users send an email to the
owner of the distribution list and the owner replies to this email request.

* *Automatically reject* -- No one can be added to this distribution list.

|Unsubscription Requests |

* *Automatically accept* --  Anyone can remove their name from the list.

* *Require list owner approval* -- To be removed from the distribution list,
users send an email to the owner.  The owner must accept the email request
to remove the name.

* *Automatically reject* -- Users cannot remove themselves from the list.

|=======================================================================

=== Management Options for Owners of Distribution Lists

You can add owners to distribution lists and they manage the list from
their ZWC account's Address Book, Distribution List folder.  Owners of a
list can right click a distribution list and click the *Edit Group* link to
edit a list.

Besides adding and deleting members, distribution list properties that
owners can configure include:

* Marking the list as private so it is hidden in the Global Address List

* Managing who can send messages to the list

* Setting a member subscription policy

* Adding additional owners

=== Creating a Distribution List

Use steps in this section to create a distribution list:

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Manage > Distribution Lists*

. From the *Gear* icon, click *New*.

. On the *Members* page, add the distribution list name.  Do not use
spaces.  The other fields are optional.

.  Find members to add to the distribution list in the right column.

addresses on the page, click *Add This Page*.  If you want to add members
that are not in the company list, in the *Or enter addresses below*
section, type a complete mail address.

. Click *Next* to configure the *Properties* page.
+
.Distribution Properties Options
[cols="1,3a",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Distribution Properties Options |Description

|Can receive mail |
Enabled by default.  If this distribution list should not receive mail
select this box.

|Hide in GAL |
Enable to create distribution lists that do not display in the Global
Address List (GAL).  You can use this feature to limit the exposure of the
distribution list to only those that know the address.

|Mail Server |
This is set to auto by default.  To select a specific mail server, uncheck
*auto* and select a specific server from the list.

|Dynamic Group |
If you check this box, the *Member URL* field displays and you create a
dynamic distribution list.

See <<create_dynamic_distribution_lists,Create Dynamic Distribution Lists>>.

|New Subscription Requests |
Select from:

* Automatically accept
* Require list owner approval
* Automatically reject

|Unsubscription Requests |
Select from:

* Automatically accept
* Require list owner approval
* Automatically reject

|=======================================================================

. In the *Members Of* page, select distribution lists that should be direct
or indirect members of the list.

. If the distribution list should have alias, create it.

. If this distribution list can be managed by other users, enter these
email addresses in the *Owners* page.

. Set how messages received to the distribution list should be replied to.

. Click *Finish*.  The distribution list is enabled and the URL is
created.

=== Managing Access to Distribution Lists

After a distribution list is created, you can manage who can view members
of a distribution list and who can send messages to a distribution list.
The default is all users have access to all distribution lists.  This
section describes how to use the CLI to manage access.

To limit who can access distribution lists, grant rights to individual
users on a domain or if you want only members of a domain to access
distribution lists, you can grant rights on the domain.  When you grant the
right on the domain, all distribution lists on the domain inherit the
grant.

You can grant the right on individual distribution lists and configure
specific users that are allowed to access the distribution list.

You can restrict access to a distribution list from the CLI
`zmprov grantRight` (`grr`) command.

[NOTE]
For more information about how granting rights works, 
see <<Delegated Administration>>.

==== Who Can View Members of a Distribution List

The default is that all users can view members addresses in a distribution
list.  A distribution list address displays a *+* in the address bubble.
Users can click on this to expand the distribution list.  A list of the
addresses in the distribution list is displayed.  Users can select
individual addresses from the expanded list.

Restricting who can view addresses in a distribution list to
individuals or to a domain:
--
* For individual users:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov grr domain <domain_name> usr <user1@example.com> viewDistList
----

* For all users in a domain:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov grr domain <domain_name> dom <example.com> viewDistList
----

* To grant rights on a distribution list and let specific users view the
  list:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov grr dl <dll_name@example.com> usr <user1@example.com>
----
--

==== Who Can Send to a Distribution List

The default is that all users can send messages to all distribution lists.
You can grant rights to a distribution list or to a domain that defines who
can send messages to a distribution list.  When users attempt to send to a
distribution list that they are not authorized to use, a message is sent
stating that they are not authorized to send messages to the recipient
distribution list.

[NOTE]
The *Milter Server* must be enabled from
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > MTA*.

Restricting who can send messages to a distribution list to individuals or
to a domain:

* Granting rights to an individual user in a domain to send messages to all
distribution lists.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov grr domain <domain_name> usr <user1@example.com> sendToDistList
----

* Granting rights to all users in a domain to send messages to all
distribution lists.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov grr domain <domain_name> dom <example.com> sendToDistList
----

Restricting access and to remove the restriction to individual distribution
lists for different user types.

* Access to specific internal users:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov grr dl <dlname@example.com> usr <username@example.com> sendToDistList
----
+
Revoke access
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov rvr dl <dlname@example.com> usr <username@example.com> sendToDistList
----

* Access only to members of the distribution list:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov grr dl <dlname@example.com> grp <dlname2@example.com> sendToDistList
----
+
Revoke access
+
[source,bash]

==== Enabling View of Distribution List Members for AD Accounts

To view Active Directory distribution list members in messages or in the
address book, the GAL group handler for Active Directory must be configured
in the {product-abbrev} GALsync account for each Active Directory.

Use steps in this section to update the GALsync account for each Active
Directory. This configuration requires that you know the GALsync account
name and all data sources on that GALsync account.

. Display the Zimbra ID of the GAL sync account:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov gd {domain} zimbraGalAccountId
----
+
To find the name:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov ga {zimbraId-of-the-GAL-sync-account} name
----

. Display data sources for the GALsync account:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov gds {gal-sync-account-name-for-the-domain}
----

. Enable the group handler for the Active Directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mds {gal-sync-account-name-for-the-domain} {AD-data-source-name} \
 zimbraGalLdapGroupHandlerClass com.zimbra.cs.gal.ADGalGroupHandler
----

[[using_dynamic_distribution_lists]]
== Using Dynamic Distribution Lists

Dynamic distribution lists automatically manage the membership.  Users are
added and removed from the distribution list automatically.  When you
create a dynamic distribution list, a member URL is specified.  This member
URL is used to identify who should be members of the list.  You can view
this URL from the Administration Console distribution list's Properties
page.

You can create dynamic distribution lists from the Administration Console
or from the CLI.  In the URL, you specify specific object classes that
identifies the type of users to be added to the dynamic distribution list.
For example, you can configure a dynamic distribution list with the object
class= zimbraAccount.  In this case, when accounts are provisioned or
accounts are deleted, the dynamic distribution list is updated.

You can create dynamic distribution lists for all mobile users or POP/IMAP
users.

You can modify a distribution list to change the filter rules.  When you
modify a distribution list, the members in the list are changed to reflect
the new rule.

[[create_dynamic_distribution_lists]]

== Moving a Mailbox

Mailboxes can be moved between Zimbra servers that share the same LDAP
server.

You can move a mailbox from either the Administration Console or use the
CLI command `zmmboxmove` to reposition a mailbox from one server to
another, without taking down the servers.

The destination server manages the mailbox move process.  The move runs in
the background and the account remains in active mode until most of the
data has been moved.  The account is locked briefly to move the last data
and then returned to active mode.

The mailbox move process goes through the following steps:

* Mailbox blobs are moved to the new server

* When most of the content has been moved, the account is put into
maintenance mode

* Database tables, index directories and any changed blobs are moved

* The account is put back into active mode

After the mailbox is moved to a new server, a copy still remains on the
older server, but the status of the old mailbox is closed.  Users cannot
log on and mail is not delivered.  Check to see that all the mailbox
content was moved successfully before purging the old mailbox.

* Moving a mailbox to a new server
+
[source,bash]
----
zmmboxmove -a <email@address> --from <servername> --to <servername>
----

* Purging the mailbox from the old server
+
[source,bash]
----
zmpurgeoldmbox -a <email@address> -s <servernamee>
----

=== Global Configuration Options for Moving Mailboxes

Global configuration options for moving a mailbox can be set to exclude
search indexes, blobs, and HSM blobs when mailboxes are moved.  The
following configuration options can be set on either the exporting server
or the destination server:

* `zimbraMailboxMoveSkipSearchIndex` --
If you do not include the search index data, the mailbox will have to be
reindexed after the move.

* `zimbraMailboxMoveSkipBlobs` --
Blobs associated with the mailbox, including primary and secondary
volumes (HSM) are excluded.

* `zimbraMailboxMoveSkipHsmBlobs` --
This is useful when HSM blobs already exist for the mailbox being moved.
Set this if `zimbraMailboxMoveSkipBlobs` is not configured, but you want to
skip blobs on HSM volumes.
