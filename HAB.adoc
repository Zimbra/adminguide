[[hierarchical_address_book]]
= Hierarchical Address Book (HAB) in {product-family}

== What is a HAB?

The hierarchical address book (HAB) allows users to look for recipients in their address book using organizational hierarchy. Typically, users only see the default global address list (GAL) whose structure doesn't help understand who reports to whom or to identify one John Doe from another. Being able to customize a HAB, which maps to your organization's unique business structure, provides your users with an efficient method for locating internal recipients.

== Using Hierarchical Address Book
In a Hierarchical Address Book (HAB), your root organization (e.g., {product-family}) is the top-level tier. Under this top-level tier, you can add several child tiers to create a customized HAB that is segmented by division, department, or any other organizational level you want to specify. The following figure illustrates a HAB for {product-family} with the following structure:

* The top-level tier represents the root organization -- {product-family}.
* The second-level child tiers represent the business divisions within {product-family} — Corporate Office, Engineering, Product Support, and Sales & Marketing.
* The third-level child tiers represent departments within the Corporate Office division — Human Resources, Accounts, and Administration.

[#SeniorityIndex]
== Seniority Index
*Seniority Index* provides an additional level in the hierarchy. When creating a HAB, use this parameter to rank individuals or organizational groups by seniority within these organizational tiers. This ranking specifies the order in which HAB displays recipients or groups. A higher seniority index ensures that a user or group appears above another with a lower seniority index.

* `100` for Vice President
* `50` for Administration Operations Manager
* `25` for Business Administrator

NOTE: If the *Seniority Index* parameter isn't set or is equal for two or more users, the HAB sorting order lists the users and groups in ascending alphabetical order.

== Configuring hierarchical address books

[#CreateOU]
=== Create an organizational unit (OU)

==== Format
 zmprov createHABOrgUnit <domain name of OU> <OU Name>

==== Example
 zmprov createHABOrgUnit example.com ZimbraOU

==== Explanation
_{product-family}OU_ as an organizational unit created.

[#createHABGroup]
=== Create groups within this OU
You have to create a group and assign an email address for each department.

==== Format

 zmprov createHABGroup <name of the group> <name of OU> <group email address>

==== Example

In this series of commands, we create *8* HAB groups -- as per the <<ExampleHierarchy>>.

 zmprov createHABGroup Zimbra ZimbraOU zimbra@example.com

 zmprov createHABGroup CorporateOffice ZimbraOU CorpOffice@example.com

 zmprov createHABGroup Engineering ZimbraOU eng@example.com

 zmprov createHABGroup ProdSupport ZimbraOU prodsupport@example.com

 zmprov createHABGroup SalesAndMarketing ZimbraOU sales-mark@example.com

 zmprov createHABGroup HumanResources ZimbraOU hr@example.com

 zmprov createHABGroup Accounts ZimbraOU accounts@example.com

 zmprov createHABGroup Administration ZimbraOU administration@example.com


[#CreateHierarchy]
=== Create Hierarchy

Each of these groups (except Zimbra) needs to be assigned a parent group to create a hierarchy.

==== Format

 zmprov addHABGroupMember ParentGroupEmailAddress ChildGroupEmailAddress

In this series of commands, we designate *7* HAB groups -- except Zimbra because it is root -- as per the hierarchy in the figure <<ExampleHierarchy>>.

For this, we add *Human Resources*, *Accounts*, and *Administration* to *Corporate Office*; and add *Corporate Office*, *Engineering*, *Product Support*, and *Sales & Marketing* to *Zimbra*.

 zmprov addHABGroupMember CorpOffice@example.com hr@example.com

 zmprov addHABGroupMember CorpOffice@example.com accounts@example.com

 zmprov addHABGroupMember CorpOffice@example.com administration@example.com

 zmprov addHABGroupMember zimbra@example.com CorpOffice@example.com

 zmprov addHABGroupMember zimbra@example.com eng@example.com

 zmprov addHABGroupMember zimbra@example.com prodsupport@example.com

 zmprov addHABGroupMember zimbra@example.com sales-mark@example.com

[#GetZimbraId]
=== Get Zimbra ID

`zimbraId` is a unique identifier associated with each email address. To <<#AddUsers, assign users to groups>> and to <<#SpecifyRoot, specify a group as root>>.

IMPORTANT: For this example, and everywhere else we have used a placeholder (xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx) for `zimbraId`.

==== Format

 zmprov gdl <group email address> zimbraId

==== Example

 zmprov gdl zimbra@example.com zimbraId

==== Example Output

 # distributionList zimbra@example.com memberCount=4
 zimbraId: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

==== Explanation
_zimbra@example.com_ is the email address of the group which is to become root.

[#AddUsers]
=== Add users to Groups

This example adds the users _Jane Doe_ and _John Smith_ to the group named _CorporateOffice_ without affecting other existing members.

==== Format

 zmprov addHABGroupMember <group email address> <user's email address>

==== Example

 zmprov addHABGroupMember hr@example.com jane.doe@example.com

 zmprov addHABGroupMember accounts@example.com john.smith@example.com

[#CreateSortOrder]
=== Set Sort Order
Configure the sort order for groups in the HAB. Groups with higher seniority index appear above groups with lower seniority index.

==== Format

 zmprov modifyHABGroupSeniority <zimbra ID> <seniority index>

==== Example

To have _Engineering_ appear above _CorporateOffice_ -- irrespective of their names and alphabetical order, get <<#GetZimbraId, Zimbra ID>>, decide on a number in place of `SeniorityIndexNumber`, and run the below command.

Assign _CorporateOffice_ a seniority index of 90

 zmprov modifyHABGroupSeniority xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx 90

Assign _Engineering_ a seniority index of 100

 zmprov modifyHABGroupSeniority xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx 100

IMPORTANT: Commands used to set seniority index for groups also set <<SeniorityIndex>> for users.

[#SpecifyRoot]
=== Specify the root organization for the HAB

A group needs to be specified as root so that other groups can be added as child groups to comply with the organizational hierarchy. Run below command to make _zimbra@example.com_ as root.

==== Format

 zmprov md <domain name> zimbraHierarchicalAddressBookRoot <ZimbraID of the group to be made root>

==== Example

 zmprov md 'example.com' zimbraHierarchicalAddressBookRoot xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

==== Example Output

 # distributionList zimbra@example.com memberCount=4
 zimbraId: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
