[[MIG-88-incremental-migration-with-backup-from-old-to-88]]
Incremental migration to Zimbra 8.8.0 with Backup NG
----------------------------------------------------

[[MIG-88-description]]
Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

* This guide describes how to perform an Incremental Migration using
Backup NG.
* It's specifically designed for the migration of a production
environment, minimizing the downtime and aiming to be transparent for
the users.
** If correctly planned and executed, your mail system won't suffer any
downtime and the impact on the users will be close to zero.
* The source server of the migration requires either Zextras Suite or Zimbra Suite Plus.
** This guide applies for migrations from any Zimbra version supported by either of those to Zimbra 8.8.
* All the CLI commands in this guide must be executed as the Zimbra
user unless otherwise specified.

[[MIG-88-what-will-be-migrated]]
What will be migrated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Emails and Email Folders.
* Contacts and Address Books.
* Appontments and Calendars.
* Tasks and Tasklists.
* Files and Briefcases.
* Share informations.
* User Preferences.
* User Settings.
* Class of Service Settings.
* Domain Settings.

[[MIG-88-what-will-not-be-migrated]]
What will NOT be migrated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Server settings (migrated for reference but not restored).
* Global Settings (migrated for reference but not restored).
* Customizations (Postfix, Jetty, etc...).
* Items moved or deleted during the process will not be moved or deleted
on the destination server.
* Preferences (e.g. passwords) changed during the process will be reset
upon each import.

WARNING: The Incremental Migration is not designed to set up a
server-to-server mirroring. Using multiple imports to create a mirrored
copy of the source server won't create a *mirrored* copy at all, since
no deletions are performed by the Import process.

[[MIG-88-source-data]]
Source Data
-----------
Data from the source server is obtained through either Zextras Suite or Zimbra Suite Plus.

* Zextras Suite can be obtained on the Zextras Website at https://www.zextras.com
* Zimbra Suite Plus can be obtained on the Zimbra website at https://www.zimbra.com

[[MIG-88-software-installation]]
Software installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you obtained the package of either Zextras Suite or Zimbra Suite Plus, the installation process is the following:

* Copy the package over to your server, in a directory owned by the root user.
* Unpack the package using `tar zxf`.
* Enter the newly created directory called either `zextras_suite-[version]` or `zimbra_suite_plus-[version]`.
* As root, run the installation script `./install.sh all`.
* Follow the installation wizard, accepting the software EULA and installing both the Core and the Zimlet component.
* Once the installation is completed, you can proceed with the guide.

WARNING: Installing Zimbra Suite Plus or Zextras Suite requires a mailboxd service restart, which will be performed during the installation.

[[MIG-88-servers]]
Servers
~~~~~~~

* The source server: any Zimbra server can be the source of your
migration, provided that it's running Backup NG or Zimbra Suite Plus.
* The destination server: any Zimbra server can be the destination of
your migratio, provided that it's running Backup NG.

[[MIG-88-storage]]
Storage
~~~~~~~

* On the Source server: If Backup NG is not currently enabled on the
source server, make sure you have an amount of free disk space
_comparable_ to the size of the `/opt/zimbra/store/` folder (the
exported data is compressed through the gzip algorythm, and all zimbra
items are deduplicated, usually reducing the size of exported to the 70%
of the original size).
* On the Destination server: Make sure you have an amount of free space
greater than the size of the `/opt/zimbra/store/` and of the `export`
folders on the source server combined.

[[MIG-88-data-transfer]]
Data Transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While you can choose to transfer the data in any other way, rsync is our
method of choice as it's a good compromise between speed and
convenience.

The main data transfer is executed while the source server is still
active and functional. However, since the transfer is performed via
network, carefully plan your transfer in advance so that you'll have
transfered *all of your data* before migrating.

[[MIG-88-alternative-ways-to-transfer-your-data]]
Alternative Ways to transfer your data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Anything spanning from remote mount to physical move of the drive is ok
as long as it suits your needs.

[[MIG-88-dns]]
DNS
~~~

Set the TTL value of your MX record to 300 on your `real` DNS. This will
allow a fast switch between source and destination server.

[[MIG-88-the-setup]]
Setting up the migration
------------------------

[[MIG-88-step-1-coherency-checks]]
Step 1: Coherency checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to avoid any possible data-related issue, run the following
checks on the source server:

* http://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Ajcody-Notes-No-Such-Blob#Zmblobchk_for_5.0.6.2B_Systems[zmblobchk]:
this command checks the consistency between Zimbra's metadata and BLOBs.
* http://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zmdbintegrityreport[zmdbintegrityreport]:
this command checks the integrity of the Zimbra's database.

Repair any error found as described in Zimbra's official documentation.

Running a reindex of all mailboxes is also suggested.

[[MIG-88-step-2-network-ng-modules-setup]]
Step 2: Network NG Modules setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Disable the Real Time Scanner on both servers:

....
zxsuite backup setProperty ZxBackup_RealTimeScanner false
....

WARNING: A dedicated device for the data export is strongly recommended in
order to improve the export performance and to lower the impact on the
performances of the running system.

Such device must be mounted on the `/opt/zimbra/backup/` path and the
Zimbra user must have r/w permissions on it

[[MIG-88-step-3-data-export-smartscan]]
Step 3: Data Export (SmartScan)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run a SmartScan on the source server:

....
zxsuite backup doSmartScan
....

All your data will be exported to the default backup path
(/opt/zimbra/backup/ng/).

[[MIG-88-pro-tip-single-domains-export]]
Pro-Tip: Single Domains Export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also choose to only migrate one or more domains instead of all
of them. To do so, run the following command *instead* of the SmartScan:

....
zxsuite backup doExport /path/to/export/folder/ domains yourdomain.com,yourdomain2.com[..]
....

Mind that if you start with the `SmartScan` method you'll have to carry
on the migration with such method, and if you start with the `Single
Domains` method you'll have to carry on the migration with this one. The
two methods cannot be mixed.

[[MIG-88-data-export-smartscan-via-the-administration-zimlet]]
Data export (SmartScan) via the Administration Zimlet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also choose to export your data using the Administration Zimlet
following

[[MIG-88-step-4-data-synchronization]]
Step 4: Data Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WARNING: When you move the exported data to the destination server make
sure that the destination folder is not Backup NG's backup path on the
destination server in order to avoid any nuisiances if you already use
Backup NG or plan to do so on the destination server.

_(You can skip this step if you choose to transfer your data by other
means than rsync.)_

Using _rsync_, copy the data contained in the
/opt/zimbra/backup/ng/ on a directory in the destination server
(make sure the Zimbra user has r/w permissions on such folder). Use a
terminal multiplexer like _screen_ or _tmux_, this process command might
need A LOT of time depending on network speed and amount of data
involved.

....
[run this command as Root]
rsync -avH /opt/zimbra/backup/ng/ root@desinationserver:/path/for/the/data/
....

[[MIG-88-alternate-synchronization-method]]
Alternate synchronization method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the suggested method is great for high-bandwidth situations, the
first synchronization can involve a lot of data. If you feel that the
rsync method is too slow, you might consider a physical move of the
device (or the proper disk file if running on a virtual environment).

After moving the disk, you can remotely mount it back to the source
server (e.g. via SSHFS), as the additional synchronizations needed for
the migration will involve much less data. In this case, be sure to
remount the device on the source server as /opt/zimbra/backup/ng/
with all due permissions.

[[MIG-88-step-5-first-import]]
Step 5: First import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import all exported data to the destination server:

....
zxsuite backup doExternalRestore /path/for/the/data/
....

Now sit back and relax while Network NG Modules imports your data on the
destination server.

''Warning: Do not edit nor delete the

[[MIG-88-first-import-via-the-administration-zimlet]]
First import via the Administration Zimlet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also choose to import your data using the Administration Zimlet
following While importing via the Administration Zimlet be sure to
remove all System Accounts (like GalSync, Ham, Spam, Quarantine etc.)
from the imported account list.

[[MIG-88-step-5-alternate-first-import-for-large-migrations-advanced-users-only]]
Step 5 (alternate): First import for large migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are to migrate a very large infrastructure where an export/import
lasts for hours or even days, there is an alternative way to handle the
migration from this point forward.

Instead of importing all of your data to the destination server, you can
run a `Provisioning Only` import that will only create Domains, Classes
of Service and Accounts on the destination server, skipping all mailbox
contents.

....
zxsuite backup doExternalRestore /path/for/the/data/ provisioning_only TRUE
....

After doing this, switch the mailflow to the new server and, when the
switch is completed, start the `real` import.

....
zxsuite backup doExternalRestore /path/for/the/data/
....

This way, your users will now connect to the new server where new emails
will be delivered while old emails are being restored.

This approach has it's pros and cons, namely:

*Pros*

* Since items are only imported once and never modified or deleted
afterwards, using this method will result in less discrepancies than the
`standard` incremental migration.
* This is the option that has less impact on the source server (e.g.
good if you are in a hurry to decommission it).

*Cons*

* Depending on the timing of the operation, this method has a higher
impact on your users due to the fact that items are restored WHILE they
work on their mailbox.
* Since the import is done on a running system, you might notice some
slowdowns.

[[MIG-88-the-situation-so-far]]
The situation so far
--------------------

Right now the vast majority of the data has already been imported to the
destination server. The source server is still active and functional,
and you are ready to perform the actual migration.

[[MIG-88-the-migration]]
The Migration
-------------

[[MIG-88-step-6-pre-migration-checks]]
Step 6: Pre-migration checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before switching the mail flow, ALWAYS make sure that the new server is
ready to become active (check your firewall, your DNS settings, your
security systems etc.)

[[MIG-88-step-7-the-switch]]
Step 7: The Switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is it, the migration moment has come! At the end of this step the
destination server will be active and functional.

* Repeat step 3, step 4 and step 5 (only new data will be exported and
synchronized)
* Switch the mail flow to the new server.
* Once NO MORE EMAILS arrive to the source server, repeat step 3, step 4
and step 5.

The Destination server is now active and functional.

[[MIG-88-step-8-post-migration-checks]]
Step 8: Post-migration checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following command to check for shares inconsistencies.

....
zxsuite backup doCheckShares
....

Should this command report any inconsistency, the

....
zxsuite backup doFixShares
....

command will parse the import mapfile used as the first argument and fix
any broken share.

Mapfiles can be found in the Backup Path of the destination server as
`map_[source_serverID]`.

[[MIG-88-step-9-galsync]]
Step 9: Galsync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete any imported GalSync accounts from the Zimbra Administration
Console, then if needed create new GalSync accounts on all the imported
domains and resync all the GalSync accounts with the following command:

....
zmgsautil forceSync -a galsync.randomstring@domain.com -n [resourcename]
....

[[MIG-88-step-10-message-deduplication]]
Step 10: Message Deduplication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running a Volume Deduplication using the HSM NG module is highly suggested after a migration.

[[MIG-88-what-now-1]]
What now?
~~~~~~~~~

* Initialize Backup NG on the new server to make sure all of your data is safe.

Incremental Migration FAQ
-------------------------

[[MIG-88-q-do-i-need-a-valid-license-in-order-to-perform-an-incremental-migration]]
Q: Do I need a valid license in order to perform an incremental migration?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. It can be either a Trial License or a purchased one.

[[MIG-88-q-what-will-be-migrated]]
Q: What will be migrated?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everything except for the server configuration. This includes:

* User Data
* User Preferences
* Classes of Service configuration
* Domain configurations

[[MIG-88-q-will-i-lose-my-shares-will-i-need-to-re-configure-all-my-shares]]
Q: Will I lose my shares? Will I need to re-configure all my shares?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Absolutely not!

[[MIG-88-q-how-should-i-transfer-the-exported-data-between-my-servers]]
Q: How should I transfer the exported data between my servers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Again, anything that suits your needs is ok. You just need to be very
sure about what your *needs* are.

Do you need to move the data very fast? Physically moving an USB disk
between your servers might not be a good idea.

Do you need to move the data in a very reliable way? Mounting the export
folder via SSHFS to the destination server might not be a good idea if
your internet connection is sloppy.
