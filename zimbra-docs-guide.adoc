//
Zimbra Docs is based on a customized LibreOffice online (LOOL) package that allows collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets and presentations from within the Zimbra WebClient.

== Components

=== Zimbra Docs Server

The Zimbra Docs server is the heart of the service.
The service hosts each document opened through a LibreOffice engine and responds to the client with every keystroke and change.

IMPORTANT: Install this component on one or more dedicated nodes running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, or Red Hat CentOS 7.

=== Zimbra Docs Extension

The extension is the component that coordinates everything.
Its main tasks are:

* Select which Docs server upon which to open the next document.
* Redirect the client when it needs to open a document.
* Read and write documents to and from system storage on behalf of the Docs server.
* Connect to each Docs server via an administrative WebSocket.
Keep track of the availability and the resource usage of each.
* Orchestrate concurrent user connections to the same document in the same server. (document sharing)

The NG Modules package contains the Zimbra Docs Extension together with the NG Core.

=== Zimbra Docs Zimlet

A Zimbra Docs Zimlet handles the integration with Briefcase and with email attachments.
It is a thin web client that connects to a native server instance via WebSocket, renders a document, and only sends changes to the client to keep the fidelity of the document on par with a desktop client while limiting network bandwidth consumption to the bare minimum.

Documents in preview and attachments are shown in read-only mode with a simplified interface, while edit mode has a full interface.

Its main tasks are:

* Change the btn:[Create] button in the {either-web-client} to the related Docs feature.
* Change the {web-client} preview feature to use Docs.
* Allow the preview of documents.

== Browser compatibility

Zimbra Docs features are available on all browsers officially supported by the {product-short} {web-client}, with some client-side limitations:

== Document Management Flow

Here is what happens behind the scenes when a user creates a document:

. The Zimlet prompts the Extension to create a new, empty document
. The Extension creates the document and returns its ID to the client
. The Zimlet opens a new Zimbra tab containing an iframe pointing towards `/service/extension/wopi-proxy`
. The extension receives the request from the client, creates a unique token for the needed document, and replies with a new URL
. The URL points toward `/docs/[docs-node-id]/[token]`, which will be proxied by nginx to the specific Docs Server node
. The Docs Server will respond with the web application in Javascript
. The web application opens a WebSocket connection, going through nginx
. Docs Server receives the WebSocket connection along with a token, sends a `read wopi` command towards the mailbox URL indicated
in the parameters (after validating the URL against allowed nodes)
. The Extension validates the token and replies with information and content
. The Docs Server node parses the document, renders it, and sends it back to the client.
. The document is fully opened and editable.

== Networking and ports
All mailbox servers will need to be able to directly communicate with the Docs Server over port 8443 (HTTPS Backend), which must be open on both ends.

The Docs Server communicates with the Extension through port 9980, so incoming traffic from all mailbox and proxy servers to that port must be allowed.
The Docs Server component must also be able to directly communicate with the master LDAP server as well as with all Mailbox servers.

== Installation and Configuration

=== Docs Nodes
Download the `zimbra-docs tgz` standalone installer, extract it and as the _root_ user execute the `install.sh` script contained in the package.

To obtain the information required for the initial Docs Server setup, run the following command on any mailbox server:

```
zimbra@mbx1:~$ zmlocalconfig -s ldap_master_url zimbra_ldap_user zimbra_ldap_userdn zimbra_ldap_password
```

This will return the info you need in the following format:

```
ldap_master_url = ldap://ldap01.cfd6a9e5.test.domain.com:389
zimbra_ldap_user = zimbra
zimbra_ldap_userdn = uid=zimbra,cn=admins,cn=zimbra
zimbra_ldap_password = Deyked4ofMarj
```

The script will install the Zimbra Docs package and then ask for information about the master LDAP, URL, username, and password, all needed to add a new server in the LDAP with just the 'docs' service installed/enabled.
Every Docs Server will be visible by every node, and will read the LDAP to write the configuration in `/opt/zimbra/conf/docs/loolwsd.xml`.

After completing the setup, you need no other configuration.

==== Adding Custom Fonts to the Docs Server To add Custom Fonts to your Docs Server, simply copy the `.ttf` font files in the `/opt/zimbra/docs/zimbra-docs-core/share/fonts/custom/` directory, then generate the new font cache and restart the docs server running `zdocs restart` as `root`.

To generate the new font cache, run the following command based on the Docs Server's Operating System:

.Ubuntu 16 and Ubuntu 18
`dpkg-reconfigure zimbra-docs-server`

.CentOS 7
`fc-cache /opt/zimbra/docs/zimbra-docs-core/share/fonts`

WARNING: The server will briefly be unavailable during a restart, and clients will need to close and re-open documents to see the new fonts in the list.

=== Mailbox Nodes
While the NG modules contain the Zimbra Docs extension, the com_zextras_docs Zimlet needs to be deployed on the server and enabled for all users and COS that need to have access to the Zimbra Docs features.

The `com_zextras_docs` Zimlet is available in the Zimbra repository, so it can be easily downloaded and deployed by running `apt-get install zimbra-docs`.

No configuration on the mailboxd side is needed after the Zimlet has been deployed and enabled.

=== Proxy Nodes
The proxy configuration must be re-generated after adding one or more Zimbra Docs Servers to the infrastructure: to do so, run `/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmproxyconfgen` as the _zimbra_ user and then restart the proxy service running `zmproxyctl restart` as the same user.

The new docs nodes' addresses get distributed via LDAP, so no manual configuration is needed.

== Licensing
.Zimbra Docs will be available on every NG for the same amount of users allowed by the {product-name} {product-version} license.
The standalone installer is released under the MPLv2 license while the extension and Zimlet are under a proprietary license.

== Removal

Before uninstalling the software, the node must be removed from LDAP either from the docs node via the command:

`zdocs remove-local-server`

or via the `zmprov` command from any Zimbra node

`zmprov deleteServer {servername}`

== Commands

=== Zimbra Docs Server CLI - `zdocs`
On a Docs server, the `zdocs` (`/usr/local/bin/zdocs` as `root`) command can generate the config for LOOL (it’s already on cron), add/remove the docs server from LDAP, test configuration and manage the service.

.`zdocs` command
[source,bash]

== Troubleshooting

.[underline]#Nothing happens when opening a document/extension requests returns 503.#
This problem is most likely due to a connection issue between the mailbox server and the Docs server.
Check the `mailbox.log` and see the reason for the connection failure.
If there are no connection errors, check the Docs server with `zdocs status` on the docs node.

The mailbox will log every connection and disconnection for each Docs server.

.[underline]#404 error code instead of docs#
The proxy configuration needs to be re-generated, and the proxy restarted.

.[.underline]#Docs opens but a message “this is embarrassing...” appears instead of the document.#
You may see this happen if the Docs server cannot connect back to the mailbox server to read and write the document.
Check name resolution and SSL certificate of `mailboxd`, which must be valid for the Docs server that does not inherit Zimbra certificate management.
