= Zimbra Docs
:toc:

== Introduction

Zimbra Docs is a new Zimbra feature based on a heavily customized LibreOffice online package allowing for collaborative editing of
documents, spreadsheets and presentations straight from the Zimbra WebClient.

== Components

=== Zimbra Docs Server

Zimbra docs server is the hearth of the service, this service will host each document opened through a libreoffice engine and respond to the
client to every keystroke and change in the document via an image.
This component must be installed on one or more dedicated nodes running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

=== Zimbra Docs Extension

The extension is the key component which coordinates everything. Its main tasks are:

* Select on which docs server the next document will be opened.
* Redirect the client when it needs to open a document.
* Read and write documents for docs server.
* Connect to each Docs server via an administrative websocket and keep track of the availability and the resource usage of each.
* Orchestrate concurrent user connections to the same document in the same server.

The Zimbra Docs Extension is contained within the NG modules package together with the NG Core.

=== Zimbra Docs Zimlet

Zimbra docs zimlet will handle the integration with briefcase and with email attachments. It is a thin web client which connects to a native
server instance via websocket, renders a document and only sends changes to the client in order to keepi the fidelity of the document on par
with a desktop client while at the same time reducing the bandwidth to the bare minimum.

Documents in preview and attachments are shown in read-only mode with reduced interface while edit mode has a full interface.

Its main tasks are:

* Change the "create" button in the ZWC to the related Docs feature.
* Change the preview feature to use Docs.
* Allow the preview of documents.

== Document Management Flow

This is what happens "behind the scenes" when a user creates a new document:

. The Zimlet prompts the Extension to create a new empty document
. The Extension creates the document and returns the document's ID to the client
. The Zimlet opens a new zimbra tab containing an iframe pointing towards '/service/extension/wopi-proxy'
. The extension receives the request from the client, creates a new token for the needed document, and replies with a new url
. The new url points toward '/docs/[docs-node-id]/[token]', which will be proxied by nginx to the specific Docs Server node
. The Docs Server will respond with the web application in Javascript
. The web application opens a websocket connection, going through the nginx
. Docs Server receives the websocket connection along with a token, sends a `read wopi` command towards the mailbox url indicated
in the parameters (the url is validates against allowed nodes)
. The Extension validates the token and replies with information and content
. The Docs Server node parses the document, renders it and sends it back to the client.
. The document is fully opened and editable.

== Networking and ports
The Docs Extension and Docs Zimlet don't require any specific open port to be functional. All mailbox servers will need to be able to diectly
communicate with the Docs Server.

The Docs Server communicates with the Extension through port 9091, so incoming traffic from all mailbox and proxy servers to that port must
be allowed. The Docs Server component must also be able to directly communicate with the master LDAP server as well as with all Proxy
servers.

== Installation and Configuration

=== Docs Nodes
Download the `zimbra-docs tgz` standalone installer, extract it and execute the the install.sh script contained in the package as root.

The script will install the zimbra docs package and then ask the information about the master ldap, url, username and password, which will
be used to add a new server in the LDAP with just the 'docs' service installed/enabled. Every Docs Server will be visible by every node, will
read the LDAP in order to write the configuration in `/opt/zimbra/conf/docs/loolwsd.xml`.

Once the setup is completed no other configuration is needed.

=== Mailbox Nodes
While the Zimbra docs extensions is already contained within the NG modules, the com_zextras_docs zimlet needs to be deployed on the
server and enabled on all users and COS that need to have access to the Zimbra Docs features.

The com_zextras_docs zimlet is available in the Zimbra repository, so it can be easily downloaded and deployed by running `apt-get
install zimbra-doc`.

No configuration on the mailboxd side is needed after the zimlet has been deployed and enabled.

=== Proxy Nodes
The proxy configuration must be re-generated after adding one or more Zimbra Docs Servers to the infrastructure: to do so, run `/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmproxyconfgen` as the zimbra user and then restart the proxy service running zmproxyctl restart as the same user.

The new docs nodes will be read from the ldap and no manual configuration is needed.

== Licensing
.The docs will be available on every NG for the same amount users allowed by the Network Edition license.
The standalone installer is released under the MPLv2 license while the extension and zimlet is released under a proprietary license.

== Commands

=== Zimbra Docs Server CLI - zdocs
On Docs server zdocs (/usr/local/bin/zdocs as root) command can generate the config for lool (it’s already on cron), add/remove the docs
server from ldap, test configuration and manage the service.

On a Mailbox server, the `zxsuite docs` command is available. This command allows to check and control the Docs service's status, to force
a configuration reload and to see the Docs Servers' status.

== Troubleshooting
.+++<u>Nothing happens when opening a document / extension requests returns 503.</u>+++
This is most likely due to a connection issue between the mailbox server and the docs server, check the mailbox.log and see the reason of
the connection failure: most of the times should be a networking issue. If there are no connection errors, check the docs server with `zdocs
status` on the docs node.

The mailbox will log every connection/disconnection for each docs server.

.+++<u>404 error code instead of docs</u>+++
The proxy configuration needs to be re-generated and the proxy restarted.

.+++<u>Docs opens but a message “this is embarrassing...” appears instead of the document.</u>+++
This happens if the docs server cannot connect back to the mailbox server to read and write the document. Check name resolution and SSL
certificate of mailboxd which must be valid for the docs server, which does not inherit zimbra certificate management.
