Alias::
    An "`also known as`" email address, which should be routed to a user at a
    different email address.

    address.

Authentication::
    Process by which user-supplied login information is used to validate
    that user’s authority to enter a system.

Blacklist::
    Anti-spam term, indicates a known bad IP address.  This could be one
    that has been hijacked by spammers, or also one from a poorly
    maintained but legitimate site that allows mail relaying from
    unauthorized parties.

Class of Service (COS)::
    Describes an object in the {product-name} LDAP data schema, which

    {product-name} command-line tools, such as zmprov.

    listing that user’s personal collection of address and contact
    information.

Ephemeral Data::
    Data which is short lived or fast changing in nature. Login timestamps, authentication tokens, etc.

Failover::

FQDN::
    Fully qualified domain name.  The hostname and the path to the host.
    For example, www.Zimbra.com is a fully qualified domain name.  www is
