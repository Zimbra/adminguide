The "Allow/Block/Quarantine" feature allows for granular access control of mobile devices connecting to the server. It's a "pre-emptive" type
of security feature, meaning that it acts upon the first connection to the server and it's made to ensure that only authorized devices can
finalize synchronization with server. This allows a full administrator to keep track of all mobile device used in their network.
Presently only CLI tools are provided; a web GUI will be released in the future.

== Components
The ABQ feature is composed of three main logical components:

- a Device Control List
- an Authorization Engine
- a set of CLI tools

=== Device Control List
The Device Control List, also known as the "ABQ List", holds the information about allowed devices within the NG config engine.
Devices can be added to the Device Control List via CLI based on their “Device ID” which can be obtained via CLI.

It is also possible to further limit access by limiting the accounts that can synchronise with the server on a specific device.

NOTE: On module startup, if the Device Control List is empty all mobile devices previously recognized by the
Zimbra server will be imported as *Allowed*.

=== Authorization Engine
The Authorization Engine takes care of checking devices against the Device Control List and setting their ABQ status to the appropriate
value.

Each rule is applied to all accounts connecting using a device it is a device id. It applies to a specific account connecting using that device if it has the format device_id/account_id or device_id/accountName

=== CLI Toolset.
The CLI Toolset allows administrators to interact with the device control list and with the synchronization status of a device, specifically to:

- Display the Device Control List
- Display all Quarantined and Blocked Devices
- Add one or more devices to the Device Control List
- Move a device from “Quarantine” to “Allowed” or “Blocked”
- Change the synchronization status of a device

Every time the administrator changes a device's status in an ABQ-enabled environment,
depending on the issued state the device will be forced to re-sync folders with the server
resulting in an immediate re-route to either a <<Dummy data,_dummy virtual mailbox_>> that will explain to the user what's happened,
or to the real mailbox to perform the re-sync.

== ABQ Modes
The ABQ feature is triggered for every mobile device that tries to synchronize with server, and can be set to one of four possible modes:
"Permissive", "Interactive", "Strict” and "Disabled". This attribute is Global for all the cluster.

=== "Permissive" mode:
The Authorization Engine is not active, so after authenticating the user and checking their account status for safety reasons, the
synchronization will continue. It is still possible to block specific devices but non-blocked devices will always be allowed to sync.

=== "Interactive" mode:
After authenticating the user and checking their account status for safety reasons, the Device Control system will check the "Device ID"
sent by the device against the list of allowed devices:

- if the device/user couple is in the "allowed" list the synchronization will continue.
- if the device/user couple is not in the device list but device is in the "allowed" list the synchronization will continue.
- if the device is not in the “allowed” list the synchronization will be paused, a dummy email notifying the user of its
"Quarantine" status will be sent and the connection will be set to "Quarantine" status.

Administrators can be notified at regular intervals, and every notification email will only include new Quarantined devices.
They will then be able to allow or deny the synchronization for each device using the appropriate CLI tools.

=== "Strict" mode:
After authenticating the user and checking their account status for safety reasons, the Device Control system will check the "Device ID"
sent by the device against the list of allowed devices:

- if the device/user couple or the device by itself is in the "allowed" list the synchronization will continue.
- if the device is not in the “allowed” list the synchronization will be put in "Blocked" state, no data will be synchronized and a
dummy email notifying the user of the device's "Blocked" status will be sent.

=== "Disabled" mode:
ABQ is disabled, no checks are triggered and no policies are enforced.

== ABQ Mode Control
The current mode can be checked by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
zxsuite config global get attribute abqMode
----
The ABQ mode can be changed running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
zxsuite config global set attribute abqMode value [Permissive|Interactive|Strict|Disabled]
----

== Dummy data
The feature makes use of “Dummy emails” and a “Dummy mailbox” to put devices on hold while waiting for authorization (Interactive Mode)
or to notify their “Blocked” status (Permissive Mode, Interactive Mode and Strict Mode).

The Dummy Mailbox is a virtual mailbox consisting of only an “Inbox” folder that will be synchronized to the device while this is in either
Quarantine or Block status. Dummy Emails are predefined email messages that are synchronized to a device in Quarantine or Block status to
alert the user. For now these messages aren't customizable, and will be localized in the future. Whenever the ABQ status of a device is
changed, the device's sync state will be reset.

This was designed to make sure the user knows what’s happening, the alternative being forcing the synchronization to fail with no descriptive
response for the user itself – which would likely cause a significant overhead on support calls.

== Notifications
Administrators can be notified via email of quarantined devices at a specific interval defined by the `abqNotificationsInterval` NG
configuration attribute, expressed in milliseconds:

The interval can be checked by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
zxsuite config global get attribute abqNotificationsInterval
----

The interval can be changed running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
zxsuite config global set attribute abqNotificationsInterval value [delay in milliseconds]
----
By default, the `abqNotificationsInterval` is set to 0 - meaning that no notifications will be delivered.

=== ABQ Service Status
The ABQ service status can be checked running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
zxsuite mobile getServices
----

The service can be stopped or started using the default service control of the Mobile NG module:

[source,bash]
----
zxsuite mobile doStartService abq
zxsuite mobile doStopService abq
----

When mode is Disabled ABQ service won't automatically start and devices are always allowed to sync.

== ABQ CLI
A list of all ABQ CLI commands can be displayed running:

[source,bash]
