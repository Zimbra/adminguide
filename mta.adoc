= Zimbra Mail Transfer Agent

The Zimbra MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) receives mail via SMTP and routes
each message using Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP) to the
appropriate Zimbra mailbox server.

[NOTE]
You can set MTA parameters with the Admin Console and the
CLI. However, it is highly recommended that you use the CLI for MTA
configuration to ensure the best results.

The Zimbra MTA server includes the following programs:

|=======================================================================

In the {product-name} configuration, mail transfer and delivery
are distinct functions: Postfix acts as a MTA, and the Zimbra mail
server acts as a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).

The MTA configuration is stored in LDAP. The `zmconfigd` process polls the
LDAP directory every two minutes for modifications and updates the
Postfix configuration files with the changes.

== Incoming Mail Routing Overview

The Zimbra mailbox server receives the messages from the Zimbra MTA
server and passes them through any filters that have been created.

The MTA server receives mail via SMTP and routes each mail message to
the appropriate mailbox server using LMTP. As each mail message arrives,
its contents are indexed so that all elements can be searched.

== Zimbra MTA Deployment

{product-abbrev} includes a precompiled version of Postfix to route and relay mail
and manage attachments. Postfix receives inbound messages via SMTP,
performs anti-virus and anti-spam filtering and hands off the mail
messages to the {product-name} server via LMTP.

Postfix also plays a role in transferring outbound messages. Messages
composed from the {product-short} {web-client} are sent by the Zimbra server
through Postfix, including messages sent to other users on the same
server.

image::mta_deployment.png[Zimbra MTA Deployment]

[TIP]
The Edge MTA can be any edge security solution for mail. You might
already deploy such solutions for functions such as filtering. Some
filtering might be duplicated between an edge MTA and the Zimbra MTA.

=== Postfix Configuration Files

Zimbra modified Postfix files -- main.cf and master.cf -- specifically to work
with {product-abbrev}:

* *main.cf* -- Modified to include the LDAP tables. The `zmconfigd` in
the Zimbra MTA pulls data from the Zimbra LDAP and modifies the Postfix
configuration files.
* *master.cf* -- Modified to use Amavisd-New.

[IMPORTANT]
Changes made to postfix configuration files will be overwritten with every
upgrade and should be well documented. If possible, try to implement any
necessary configuration changes using Zimbra defined parameters.

== SMTP Authentication

SMTP authentication allows authorized mail clients from external
networks to relay messages through the Zimbra MTA. The user ID and
password is sent to the MTA when the SMTP client sends mail so that the
MTA can verify if the user is allowed to relay mail.

The user ID and password is sent to the MTA when the SMTP client sends
mail. This ensures that the MTA can verify if the user is allowed to
relay mail, by checking the associated credentials with the LDAP
account.

[NOTE]
User authentication is provided through the Zimbra LDAP
directory server, or if implemented, through the Microsoft Active
Directory Sever.

=== SMTP Restrictions

You can enable restrictions so that messages are not accepted by Postfix
when non-standard or other disapproved behavior is exhibited by an
incoming SMTP client. These restrictions provide some protection against
spam senders. By default, clients that do not greet with a fully
qualified domain name are restricted. DNS based restrictions are also
available.

[IMPORTANT]
Understand the implications of these restrictions before
you implement them. You might have to compromise on these checks to
accommodate people outside of your system who have poorly implemented
mail systems.

=== Sending Non Local Mail to a Different Server

You can configure Postfix to send nonlocal mail to a different SMTP
server, commonly referred to as a relay or smart host.

A common use case for a relay host is when an ISP requires that all your
email be relayed through a designated host, or if you have filtering
SMTP proxy servers.

The relay host setting must not be confused with Web mail MTA setting.
Relay host is the MTA to which Postfix relays non-local email. Webmail
MTA is used by the Zimbra server for composed messages and must be the
location of the Postfix server in the Zimbra MTA package.

To use the Administration Console to configure Relay MTA for external
delivery:

Admin Console: ::
*Home -> Configure -> Global Settings -> MTA -> Network*

[IMPORTANT]
To prevent mail loops, use caution when setting the relay host.

image::sending_non_local_mail_to_different_server.png[MTA Settings]

== Anti-Virus and Anti-Spam Protection

The Amavisd-New utility is the interface between the Zimbra MTA and Clam
Anti-Virus (ClamAV) and SpamAssassin scanners.

=== Anti-Virus Protection

ClamAV software is the virus protection engine enabled for each {product-abbrev}
server.

The anti-virus software is configured to put messages that have been
identified as having a virus to the virus quarantine mailbox. By
default, the Zimbra MTA checks every two hours for any new anti-virus
updates from ClamAV.

You can change anti-virus settings at the Administration Console.

Admin Console: ::
*Home -> Configure -> Global Settings -> AS/AV -> Anti-virus Settings*

image::anti_virus_protection.png[Anti-Virus Protection]

[NOTE]
Updates are obtained via HTTP from the ClamAV website.

==== Scanning Attachments in Outgoing Mail

You can enable real-time scanning of attachments in outgoing emails sent
using the {product-short} {web-client}. If enabled, when an attachment is added to
an email, it is scanned using ClamAV prior to sending the message. If
ClamAV detects a virus, it will block attaching the file to the message.
By default, scanning is configured for a single node installation.

To enable scanning, using a single node:

[source, bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraAttachmentsScanURL clam://localhost:3310/
zmprov mcf zimbraAttachmentsScanEnabled TRUE
----

To enable scanning in a multi-node environment:

1.  Designate the MTA nodes to handle ClamAV scanning.
2.  Enable, as follows:
+
[source, bash]
----
zmprov ms <mta_server> zimbraClamAVBindAddress <mta_server>
zmprov mcf zimbraAttachmentsScanURL clam://<mta_server>:3310/
zmprov ms <mailbox_server> zimbraAttachmentsScanEnabled TRUE
----

=== Anti-Spam Protection

Zimbra uses SpamAssassin to identify unsolicited commercial email (spam)
with learned data stored in either the Berkeley DB database or a MariaDB
database. You can also use the Postscreen function to provide additional
protection against mail server overload. Both strategies are described
in the following topics:

* <<spam_assassin_methods,Spam Assassin Methods for Avoiding Spam>>
* <<postscreen_methods,Postscreen Methods for Avoiding Spam>>

[[spam_assassin_methods]]
==== Spam Assassin Methods for Avoiding Spam

Usage guidelines are provided in the following topics:

* <<spam_assassin_score,Managing the Spam Assassin Score>>
* <<training_spam_filter,Training the Spam Filter>>
* <<config_final_destination_spam,Configuring Final Destination for Spam>>
* <<setting_up_trusted_netorks,Setting Up Trusted Networks>>
* <<enabling_milter_server,Enabling a Milter Server>>

[NOTE]
For information about how to customize SpamAssassin, see
https:// wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Anti-spam_strategies.

[[spam_assassin_score]]
*Managing the Spam Assassin Score:* SpamAssassin uses predefined rules
as well as a Bayes database to score messages with a numerical range.
Zimbra uses a percentage value to determine "`spaminess`" based on a
SpamAssassin score of 20 as 100%. Any message tagged between 33%-75% is
considered spam and delivered to the user's junk folder. Messages tagged
above 75% are always considered spam and discarded.

You can change the spam percentage settings, and the subject prefix at
the Administration Console.

Admin Console: ::
*Home -> Configure -> Global Settings -> AS/AV -> Spam checking Settings*

image::spam_assassin.png[Spam Assassin Settings]

By default, Zimbra uses the Berkeley DB database for spam training. You
can also use a MariaDB database.

To use the MariaDB method on the MTA servers:
[source, bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -e antispam_mariadb_enabled=TRUE
----
When this is enabled, Berkeley DB database is not enabled.

[[training_spam_filter]]
*Training the Spam Filter* -- The effectiveness of the anti-spam filter is
dependent on user input to differentiate spam or ham. The SpamAssassin
filter learns from messages that users specifically mark as spam by
sending them to their junk folder or not spam by removing them from
their junk folder. A copy of these marked messages is sent to the
appropriate spam training mailbox.

At installation, a spam/ham cleanup filter is configured on only the
first MTA. The {product-abbrev} spam training tool, `zmtrainsa`, is configured to
automatically retrieve these messages and train the spam filter. The
`zmtrainsa` script empties these mailboxes each day.

[NOTE]
--
New installations of {product-abbrev} limit spam/ham training to the first
MTA installed. If you uninstall or move this MTA, you will need to
enable spam/ham training on another MTA, as one host should have this
enabled to run `zmtrainsa --cleanup`.

To set this on a new MTA server:
[source, bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -e zmtrainsa_cleanup_host=TRUE
----
--

Initially, you might want to train the spam filter manually to quickly
build a database of spam and non-spam tokens, words, or short character
sequences that are commonly found in spam or ham. To do this, you can
manually forward messages as message/rfc822 attachments to the spam and
non-spam mailboxes. When `zmtrainsa` runs, these messages are used to teach
the spam filter. Make sure you add a large enough sampling of messages to
get accurate scores. To determine whether to mark messages as spam at least
200 known spams and 200 known hams must be identified.

[[spamassassin_sa_update_tool]]
SpamAssassin's `sa-update` tool is included with SpamAssassin. This tool
updates SpamAssassin rules from the SA organization. The tool is
installed into `/opt/zimbra/common/bin`.

[[config_final_destination_spam]]
*Configuring Final Destination for Spam* -- You can configure Amavis
behavior to handle a spam item's final destination by using the following
attribute:

`zimbraAmavisFinalSpamDestiny`

The default is `D_DISCARD` (which will not deliver the email to the
addressee).

Setting final spam destiny attributes:
[source, bash]
----
zmprov mcf "zimbraAmavisFinalSpamDestiny" D_PASS
zmprov ms serverhostname.com D_PASS
----

.Configurable attribute values
[cols="1m,3a",options="header",]
|====
|Value | Description

|D_PASS |
Deliver the email to the recipient. The email is likely to be placed in
the recipient's junk folder (although some sites disable junk).

|D_BOUNCE |
The email is bounced back to the sender. Because this setting can create
backscatter -- as the "sender" is not the person who actually sent the
email -- it is not advised.

|D_REJECT|
Reject the email. This setting reduces the chance of backscatter:

* If the sender is valid, the MTA will notify this person about the rejection.
* If the sender is not valid, the associated MTA will discard the email (i.e. email that was sent by a spammer spoofing someone else).

|D_DISCARD |
The email is silently discarded (not delivered).
|====

[[setting_up_trusted_netorks]]
*Setting Up Trusted Networks:* The {product-abbrev} configuration allows
relaying only for the local network, but you can configure trusted networks
that are allowed to relay mail. You set the MTA trusted networks as a
global setting, but you can configure trusted networks as a server
setting. The server setting overrides the global setting.

To use the Administration Console to set up MTA trusted networks as a
global setting:

Admin Console: ::
*Home -> Configure -> Global Settings -> MTA -> Network*

image::mta_network.png[MTA Trusted Networks]

When using the Administration Console to set up MTA trusted networks on
a per server basis, first ensure that MTA trusted networks have been set
up as global settings.

Admin Console: ::
*Home -> Configure -> Servers -> _server_ -> MTA -> Network*

image::mta_network_2.png[MTA Trusted Networks]

Enter the network addresses separated by _commas_ and/or a _space_. Continue
long lines by starting the next line with space, similar to the
following examples:

----
127.0.0.0/8, 168.100.189.0/24
127.0.0.0/8 168.100.189.0/24 10.0.0.0/8 [::1]/128 [fe80::%eth0]/64
----

[[enabling_milter_server]]
*Enabling a Milter Server:* Milter server can be enabled to enforce
restrictions on which addresses can send to distribution lists and add
*Reply-To* and *X-Zimbra-DL* headers to messages sent from distribution
lists. This can be enabled globally or for specific servers from the
Administration Console.

[NOTE]
Only enable a Milter Server on a server where an MTA is running.

For global configuration, enable the milter server from the
Administration Console:

Admin Console: ::
*Home -> Configure -> Global Settings -> MTA -> Milter Server*

image::mta_milter.png[MTA Milter Server]

Use the Administration Console to enable a specific milter server, and
to set bind addressing for individual servers.

Admin Console: ::
*Home -> Configure -> Servers -> _server_ -> MTA -> Milter Server*

image::mta_milter_2.png[MTA Milter Server]

[[postscreen_methods]]
==== Postscreen Methods for Avoiding Spam

Zimbra Postscreen is the 8.7 enhancement to the {product-name}
anti-spam strategy, to provide additional protection against mail server
overload. By design, Postscreen is not an SMTP proxy. Its purpose is to
keep spambots away from Postfix SMTP server processes, while minimizing
overhead for legitimate traffic. A single Postscreen process handles
multiple inbound SMTP connections and decides which clients may communicate
to a Post-fix SMTP server process. By keeping spambots away, Postscreen
frees up SMTP server processes for legitimate clients, and delays the onset
of server overload conditions.

In a typical deployment, Postscreen handles the MX service on TCP port 25,
while MUA clients submit mail via the submission service on TCP port 587,
which requires client authentication. Alternatively, a site could set up a
dedicated, non-Postscreen, "`port 25`" server that provides submission
service and client authentication without MX service.

[IMPORTANT]
Postscreen should not be used on SMTP ports that receive mail from end-user
clients (MUAs).

{product-name} Postscreen maintains a temporary white-list for
clients that have passed a number of tests. When an SMTP client IP address
is whitelisted, Postscreen immediately passes the connection to a Postfix
SMTP server process. This minimizes the overhead for legitimate mail.

In a typical scenario that uses Postscreen service, it is reasonable
to expect potentially malicious email entities -- such as bots and
zombies -- to be mixed in with friendly candidates in email
loads. This concept is illustrated in the following diagram, in which
undesirable entities are depicted in red; good email candidates are
green.

image::postscreen.png[Postscreen]

Postscreen performs basic checks and denies connection(s) that are clearly
from a bot or zombie. If the connection is not in the temporary whitelist,
Postscreen passes the email to the local Anti-SPAM and Anti-Virus engines,
which can either accept it or deny it. Good connections are accepted via
Postscreen security, then allowed to talk directly with the SMTP daemon,
which scans the Email (as usual) with the AS/AV. By default, all bots or
zombies are rejected.

Use Zimbra CLI attributes to set parameters for Postscreen operations. For
any <<postscreen_attributes,Postscreen Attributes>> that provide the
ignore, enforce, or drop instruction, use guidelines as follows:

* _ignore_ -- Ignore this result. Allow other tests to complete. Repeat this
test with subsequent client connections. This is the default setting, which
is useful for testing and collecting statistics without blocking mail.

* _enforce_ -- Allow other tests to complete. Reject attempts to deliver
mail with a 550 SMTP reply, and log the hello/sender/recipient
information. Repeat this test with subsequent client connections.

* _drop_ -- Drop the connection immediately with a 521 SMTP reply.
Repeat this test with subsequent client connections.

[[postscreen_attribtutes]]
*Postscreen Attributes:*

Go to the `zmprov mcf` prompt (release 8.7+) to use Postscreen commands.
You can see example usages of these attributes in
<<enabling_postscreen,Enabling Postscreen>>.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenAccessList` -- Default = permit_mynetworks
+
Postconf `postscreen_access_list` setting, which is the permanent white/
blacklist for remote SMTP client IP addresses. Postscreen(8) searches this
list immediately after a remote SMTP client connects. Specify a comma- or
whitespace -separated list of commands (in upper or lower case) or lookup
tables. The search stops upon the first command that fires for the client
IP address.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenBareNewlineAction` -- Default = ignore
+
The action that postscreen(8) is to take when a remote SMTP client sends a
bare newline character, that is, a newline not preceded by carriage return --
as either ignore, enforce, or drop.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenBareNewlineEnable` -- Default = no
+
Enable (yes) or disable (no) "`bare newline`" SMTP protocol tests in the
postscreen(8) server. These tests are expensive: a remote SMTP client must
disconnect after it passes the test, before it can talk to a real Postfix
SMTP server.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenBareNewlineTTL` -- Default = 30d
+
The amount of time allowable for postscreen(8) to use the result of a
successful "`bare newline`" SMTP protocol test. During this time, the client
IP address is excluded from this test. The default setting is lengthy
because a remote SMTP client must disconnect after it passes the test,
before it can talk to a real Postfix SMTP server.
+
Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional
one-letter suffix that specifies the time unit). Time units: s (seconds), m
(minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenBlacklistAction` -- Default = ignore
+
The action that postscreen(8) is to take when a remote SMTP client is
permanently blacklisted with the `postscreen_access_list` parameter, as
either ignore, enforce, or drop.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenCacheCleanupInterval` -- Default = 12h
+
--
The amount of time allowable between postscreen(8) cache cleanup runs.
Cache cleanup increases the load on the cache database and should therefore
not be run frequently. This feature requires that the cache database
supports the "`delete`" and "`sequence`" operators. Specify a zero interval to
disable cache cleanup.

After each cache cleanup run, the postscreen(8) daemon logs the number of
entries that were retained and dropped. A cleanup run is logged as
"`partial`" when the daemon terminates early after `postfix reload`, `postfix
stop`, or no requests for `$max_idle` seconds.

Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
--

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenCacheRetentionTime` -- Default = 7d
+
The amount of time that postscreen(8) is allowed to cache an expired
temporary whitelist entry before it is removed. This prevents clients from
being logged as "`NEW`" just because their cache entry expired an hour
ago. It also prevents the cache from filling up with clients that passed
some deep protocol test once and never came back.
+
Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenCommandCountLimit` -- Default = 20
+
Value to set the limit on the total number of commands per SMTP session for
postscreen(8)'s built-in SMTP protocol engine. This SMTP engine defers or
rejects all attempts to deliver mail, therefore there is no need to enforce
separate limits on the number of junk commands and error commands.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenDnsblAction` -- Default = ignore
+
The action that postscreen(8) is to take when a remote SMTP client's
combined DNSBL score is equal to or greater than a threshold (as defined
with the `postscreen_dnsbl_sites` and `postscreen_dnsbl_threshold`
parameters), as either ignore, enforce, or drop.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenDnsblSites`
+
--
Optional list of DNS white/blacklist domains, filters and weight
factors. When the list is non-empty, the dnsblog(8) daemon will query
these domains with the IP addresses of remote SMTP clients, and
postscreen(8) will update an SMTP client's DNSBL score with each non-error
reply.

[WARNING]
When postscreen rejects mail, it replies with the DNSBL domain name. Use the
`postscreen_dnsbl_reply_map` feature to hide "`password`" information in
DNSBL domain names.

When a client's score is equal to or greater than the threshold specified
with `postscreen_dnsbl_threshold`, postscreen(8) can drop the connection
with the remote SMTP client.

Specify a list of `domain=filter*weight` entries, separated by comma or
whitespace.

* When no `=filter` is specified, postscreen(8) will use any non-error
DNSBL reply. Otherwise, postscreen(8) uses only DNSBL replies that match
the filter. The filter has the form `d.d.d.d`, where each d is a number, or a
pattern inside `[]` that contains one or more "`;`"-separated
numbers or number..number ranges.

* When no `*weight` is specified, postscreen(8) increments the remote SMTP
client's DNSBL score by 1. Otherwise, the weight must be an integral
number, and postscreen(8) adds the specified weight to the remote SMTP
client's DNSBL score. Specify a negative number for whitelisting.

* When one `postscreen_dnsbl_sites` entry produces multiple DNSBL
responses, postscreen(8) applies the weight at most once.

Examples:

To use example.com as a high-confidence blocklist, and to block mail
with example.net and example.org only when both agree:
----
postscreen_dnsbl_threshold = 2
postscreen_dnsbl_sites = example.com*2, example.net, example.org
----

To filter only DNSBL replies containing 127.0.0.4:
----
postscreen_dnsbl_sites = example.com=127.0.0.4
----
--

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenDnsblThreshold` -- Default = 1
+
Value to define the inclusive lower bound for blocking a remote SMTP
client, based on its combined DNSBL score as defined with the
`postscreen_dnsbl_sites` parameter.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenDnsblTTL` -- Default = 1h
+
The amount of time allowable for postscreen(8) to use the result from a
successful DNS-based reputation test before a client IP address is required
to pass that test again.
+
Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional
one-letter suffix that specifies the time unit). Time units: s (seconds), m
(minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenDnsblWhitelistThreshold` -- Default = 0
+
Allow a remote SMTP client to skip "`before`" and "`after 220 greeting`"
protocol tests, based on its combined DNSBL score as defined with the
`postscreen_dnsbl_sites` parameter.
+
Specify a negative value to enable this feature. When a client passes the
`postscreen_dnsbl_whitelist_threshold` without having failed other tests, all
pending or disabled tests are flagged as completed with a time-to-live
value equal to `postscreen_dnsbl_ttl`. When a test was already completed, its
time-to-live value is updated if it was less than `postscreen_dnsbl_ttl`.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenGreetAction` -- Default = ignore
+
The action that postscreen(8) is to take when a remote SMTP client speaks
before its turn within the time specified with the `postscreen_greet_wait`
parameter, as either ignore, enforce, or drop.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenGreetTTL` -- Default = 1d
+
The amount of time allowed for postscreen(8) to use the result from a
successful PREGREET test. During this time, the client IP address is
excluded from this test. The default is relatively short, because a good
client can immediately talk to a real Postfix SMTP server.
+
Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional
one-letter suffix that specifies the time unit). Time units: s (seconds), m
(minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenNonSmtpCommandAction` -- Default = drop
+
The action that postscreen(8) takes when a remote SMTP client sends
non-SMTP commands as specified with the `postscreen_forbidden_` commands
parameter, as either ignore, enforce, or drop.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenNonSmtpCommandEnable` -- Default = no
+
Enable (yes) or disable (no) "non- SMTP command" tests in the postscreen(8)
server. These tests are expensive: a client must disconnect after it passes
the test, before it can talk to a real Postfix SMTP server.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenNonSmtpCommandTTL` -- Default = 30d
+
The amount of time allowable for postscreen(8) to use the result from a
successful "`non_smtp_command`" SMTP protocol test. During this time, the
client IP address is excluded from this test. The default is long because a
client must disconnect after it passes the test, before it can talk to a
real Postfix SMTP server.
+
Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional
one-letter suffix that specifies the time unit). Time units: s (seconds), m
(minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenPipeliningAction` -- Default = enforce
+
The action that postscreen(8) is to take when a remote SMTP client sends
multiple commands instead of sending one command and waiting for the server
to respond, as either ignore, enforce, or drop.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenPipeliningEnable` -- Default = no
+
Enable (yes) or disable (no) "`pipelining`" SMTP protocol tests in the
postscreen(8) server. These tests are expensive: a good client must
disconnect after it passes the test, before it can talk to a real Postfix
SMTP server.

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenPipeliningTTL` -- Default = 30d
+
Time allowable for postscreen(8) to use the result from a successful
"`pipelining`" SMTP protocol test. During this time, the client IP address is
excluded from this test. The default is lengthy because a good client must
disconnect after it passes the test, before it can talk to a real Postfix
SMTP server.
+
Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional
one-letter suffix that specifies the time unit). Time units: s (seconds), m
(minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenWatchdogTimeout` -- Default = 10s
+
Time allowable for a postscreen(8) process to respond to a remote SMTP
client command, or to perform a cache operation, before it is terminated by
a built-in watchdog timer. This is a safety mechanism that prevents
postscreen(8) from becoming non-responsive due to a bug in Postfix itself
or in system software. To avoid false alarms and unnecessary cache
corruption this limit cannot be set under 10s.
+
Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional
one-letter suffix that specifies the time unit). Time units: s (seconds), m
(minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenWhitelistInterfaces`
+
--
A list of local postscreen(8) server IP addresses where a non-whitelisted
remote SMTP client can obtain postscreen(8)'s temporary whitelist
status. This status is required before the client can talk to a Postfix
SMTP server process. By default, a client can obtain postscreen(8)'s
whitelist status on any local postscreen(8) server IP address.

When postscreen(8) listens on both primary and backup MX addresses, the
`postscreen_whitelist_interfaces` parameter can be configured to give the
temporary whitelist status only when a client connects to a primary MX
address. Once a client is whitelisted it can talk to a Postfix SMTP server
on any address. Thus, clients that connect only to backup MX addresses will
never become whitelisted, and will never be allowed to talk to a Postfix
SMTP server process.

Specify a list of network addresses or network/netmask patterns, separated
by commas and/or whitespace. The netmask specifies the number of bits in
the network part of a host address. Continue long lines by starting the
next line with whitespace.

You can also specify `/file/name` or `type:table` patterns. A `/file/name`
pattern is replaced by its contents; a `type:table` lookup table is matched
when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).

The list is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first
match. Specify `!pattern` to exclude an address or network block from the
list.

[NOTE]
IPv6 address information must be specified inside `[]` in
the `postscreen_whitelist_interfaces` value, and in files specified with
`/file/name`. IP version 6 addresses contain the "`:`" character, and would
otherwise be confused with a `type:table` pattern.

[[dont-whitelist-connections-to-the-backup-ip-address]]
Example:
----
/etc/postfix/main.cf:

# Don't whitelist connections to the backup IP address.
postscreen_whitelist_interfaces = !168.100.189.8, static:all
----
--

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenDnsblMinTTL` -- Default = 60s
+
The minimum amount of time that postscreen(8) is allowed -- resulting from a
successful DNS -based reputation test -- before a client IP address is
required to pass that test again. If the DNS reply specifies a larger TTL
value, that value will be used unless it would be larger than
`postscreen_dnsbl_max_ttl`.
+
Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional
one-letter suffix that specifies the time unit). Time units: s (seconds), m
(minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

* `zimbraMtaPostscreenDnsblMaxTTL` -- Default = postscreen dnsbl ttl
+
--
The maximum amount of time allowable for postscreen(8) to use the result
from a successful DNS-based reputation test before a client IP address is
required to pass that test again. If the DNS reply specifies a shorter TTL
value, that value will be used unless it would be smaller than
`postscreen_dnsbl_min_ttl`.

Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional
one-letter suffix that specifies the time unit). Time units: s (seconds), m
(minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).

Note that the default setting is backwards-compatible with Postscreen
versions earlier than 3.1.

*Testing Postscreen:*

Testing uses Postscreen to view results without taking any action. In a
testing scenario, you instruct Postscreen to log email connections without
taking action on them. Once you are satisfied with the results, you can set
Postscreen values to enforce or drop emails, as required.

1.  Set up the DNS-based Blackhole List (DNSBL).
2.  Set Postscreen to ignore.

The following real-world example demonstrates return of a 550 error from
Postscreen during a test session:

== Receiving and Sending Mail

The Zimbra MTA delivers the incoming and the outgoing mail messages. For
outgoing mail, the Zimbra MTA determines the destination of the recipient
address. If the destination host is local, the message is passed to the
Zimbra server for delivery. If the destination host is a remote mail
server, the Zimbra MTA must establish a communication method to transfer
the message to the remote host. For incoming messages, the MTA must be able
to accept connection requests from remote mail servers and receive messages
for the local users.

To send and receive email, the MTA must be configured in DNS with both an A
record and an MX Record. For sending mail, the MTA uses DNS to resolve
hostnames and email-routing information. To receive mail, the MX record
must be configured correctly to route messages to the mail server.

You must configure a relay host if you do not enable DNS.

=== Message Queues

When the Zimbra MTA receives mail, it routes the mail through a series of
queues to manage delivery; incoming, active, deferred, hold, and corrupt.

image::message_queues.png[Message Queues]

The *incoming* message queue holds the new mail that has been received.
Each message is identified with a unique file name. Messages are moved to
the active queue when there is room. If there are no problems, message move
through this queue very quickly.

The *active* message queue holds messages that are ready to be sent. The
MTA sets a limit to the number of messages that can be in the active queue
at any one time. From here, messages are moved to and from the anti-virus
and anti-spam filters before being delivered to another queue.

Messages that cannot be delivered are placed in the *deferred* queue.  The
reasons for the delivery failures are documented in a file in the deferred
queue. This queue is scanned frequently to resend the message.  If the
message cannot be sent after the set number of delivery attempts, the
message fails and is bounced back to the original sender. You can choose to
send a notification to the sender that the message has been deferred.

The *hold* message queue keeps mail that could not be processed.  Messages
stay in this queue until the administrator moves them. No periodic delivery
attempts are made for messages in the hold queue.

The *corrupt* queue stores damaged unreadable messages.

You can monitor the mail queues for delivery problems from the
Administration Console. See
<<monitoring_zcs_servers,Monitoring {product-abbrev} Servers>>.
