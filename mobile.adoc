:toc:

Zimbra Mobile provides over-the-air synchronization of mail, contacts,
calendar and task data and device security policy enforcement between
the mobile device and an account on the mailbox server.

[NOTE]

Zimbra also has the Touch Client available. For more information, go to
https://www.zimbra.com for the latest revision of this guide and see the Zimbra Web
Client User Guide.

The ActiveSync protocol is used to configure and sync the Zimbra mailbox
server with the native client that is used on a user's device.

Zimbra Mobile is compatible with iPhone, iPod Touch, Windows Mobile 5
(WM5), and 6 (WM6) devices, and many other phones that support the
ActiveSync protocol.

== Mobile Device Security Policies

The administrator can configure mobile security policies to enforce
security rules on compliant mobile devices that sync with {product-name}
accounts.

The following features can be configured to enhance the security of mobile
devices.

* Remote wipe to erase all data from the device if the mobile device is
lost or stolen.

* Device password policies to set up strong password enforcement including
minimum password length, inactivity time, enforce password history, and
wipe device after configured failed sign in attempts

* S/MIME encryption policies to enable S/MIME usage and set the policies
for sending and signing encrypted messages.

In addition, you can manage the following device usage options.

* Sync settings for past calendar and email items, message size,
  formatting.

* Device settings, such as cameras, desktop sync, bluetooth, use of
removable storage can be disabled.

[NOTE]
Only WM6 devices and IPhones support security policies set by the
server. Older devices do not respond to security policies.

== Setting Up Mobile Policies on {product-abbrev}

You can manage mobile device policies from the Administration Console as a
Class of Service or for individual accounts.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Class of Service -> _COS_ -> Mobile Access -> General* +

== Managing Mobile Devices

After the mobile policy is set up, the next time a mobile device sends a
request to the server, mobile devices that are capable of enforcing
security policies automatically set up the rules and immediately enforces
them.

For example, if a password has not been set up on the device or the
password is not as strong as required by the mobile policy, the user must
fix the password before syncing with the server. Once the server confirms
that the policy is enforced on the mobile device, the device can sync.

If a mobile device is lost or stolen, the device is protected by the
following policy rules:

* When the *Password re-entry required after inactivity (min)* is
configured, after the number of minutes configured, the device is
locked. To unlock the device, users must re enter their password.

* When the *Failure attempts allowed* is configured, after the password is
entered incorrectly more than the specified number of times, a locally
(generated by the device) initiated wipe of the device is performed. This
erases all data on the device.

In addition to the rules set up from the Administration Console to perform
a local device wipe, users can initiate a remote wipe from their ZWC
account to erase all data on lost, stolen, or retired devices.

=== Supporting Autodiscover

{product-abbrev} supports the Autodiscover service so that users can provision mobile
devices for their Zimbra accounts without having to know the server
settings. Autodiscover returns the required server settings after users
enter their email address and password.

Autodiscover is enabled by default. For autodiscover to work, you must
configure a valid SSL certificate from a certification authority.

The recommended type of certificate to use is a Unified Communications
Certificate or UCC. This certificate lets you add multiple host names in
the Subject Alternative Name field. For autodiscover to work, the Subject
Alternative Name field must include the hostnames users are connecting to.

You must have a valid domain name service (DNS SRV record) for
`autodiscover.<domain>.com` so that the client devices can locate and
connect to the autodiscover service.

Use the Install Certificates wizard on the Administration Console to
generate the certificate signing request and to install the signed
certificate when received. Unified Communications Certificates can be
issued by many certification authorities.

When you complete the request you must have a valid domain name service
(DNS SRV record) for `autodiscover.<domain>.com`. Configure the *Subject
Alternative Name* (SAN) field with the valid domain names that you use.
Thealternative name should include the domain
`autodiscover.<company>.com`. Include all the domain names required for
your environment in the Subject Alternative Name field.

[NOTE]
Make sure that the web server mode is https, both, redirect, or mixed as
the autodiscover and other communications from devices is HTTPS.

=== Set Up Mobile Synchronization for User Accounts

Mobile sync is enabled either in the COS profiles for the account or on
individual accounts. In most cases, no additional plug-ins are required.

Users might need to configure the following on their in the mobile device
to sync to their Zimbra account if they don't have auto discover.

* *Server name (address)* -- Enter the fully qualified host name of the
user's{product-name} mailbox server.

* *User name* -- Enter the user's primary {product-name} account name.

* *Domain* -- Enter the user's {product-name} domain name (DNS).

* *SSL certificate* -- the server might have to be added to the device
as trusted if TLS is used when the certification is self-signed.

Users can sync their {product-abbrev} account to their mobile device. They
can send email, create appointments, and add contacts to their address
book.

For details about specific device setup, see the Mobile Device Setup pages
on the https://wiki.zimbra.com[Zimbra Wiki].

=== Change Mobile Device Password Policy

If a mobile device is locked by the {product-name} mobile password
policy, the PIN requirement must be removed to resync the device.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Manage > Accounts -> _account_ -> Mobile Access*

. Open the user account to be modified.

. On the *Mobile Access* page, uncheck *Force pin on device*.

. After the password policy has been disabled, the user must resync
the device:
+
* If the device is a WM6 device, the user syncs to the account. After the
sync has completed, instruct the user to go to the *Lock* setting on the
device and *turn off the device PIN.*
+
* If the device is an iPhone/iPod Touch 3.0 or above, the user syncs to
the account. After the sync, instruct the user to go to the
*Settings > General* properties and *turn off Passcode Lock*.

[NOTE]
If the iPhone/iPod Touch is prior to 3.0, there is an Apple software bug
that prevents downloading new device policies to take effect. The user must
delete the {product-name} account from the iPhone/iPod Touch, turn
the PIN off, and then re-setup sync with the {product-name}. Because
the password requirement was turned off, a PIN is not asked for.

== User's Mobile Device Self-Care Features

Users can directly manage the following device functions.

* Perform a remote wipe of a device.
+
If a mobile device is lost, stolen, or no longer being used, users can
initiate a remote wipe from their ZWC account to erase all data from the
mobile device. The device is returned to its original factory settings.

* Suspend a sync that has been initiated from the mobile device and resume
the sync to the device.

* Delete the device from their list.

If a device is deleted from the list and the device attempts to sync after
that, the server forces the device to fetch the the policy again on the
next sync.
