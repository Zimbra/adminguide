= Configuring SPNEGO Single Sign-On

The SPNEGO protocol mechanism can be configured on {product-abbrev} for single sign-on
authentication to the Zimbra Web Client and to the Zimbra Connector for
Outlook (ZCO). For ZCO configuration see
<<setting_up_single_sign_on_options_for_zco,Setting Up Single Sign-On
Options for ZCO>>.

From ZWC, when users log on to their Intranet through Active Directory,
they can enter their ZWC mailbox without having to re-authenticate to
Zimbra.

The {product-abbrev} server is configured to redirect users attempting to log on to ZWC
to a URL under SPNEGO protection. The server asks for authentication with
Kerberos through SPNEGO and users are redirected to their ZWC mailbox. When
users log out, they are redirected to a logout URL that displays a Launch
button. When users click *Launch*, they are directed to the ZWC entry page.

[NOTE]
When users log on to their ZWC accounts from the Internet, the ZWC log in
page displays and they must enter their ZWC password to log on.

[IMPORTANT]
If SPNEGO SSO is enabled on a domain, the browsers must be configured
correctly. See <<configure_your_browser,Configure Your
Browser>>. Improperly configured browsers may pop up a user/pass dialog and
if a user enters his correct AD domain username/password, he can still log
into the Zimbra mailbox, and some browsers may display a "401 Unauthorized"
error.

== Configuration Process

. Create the Kerberos keytab file.
* Create an Active Directory service account. This account is used to
generate the Kerberos keytab file.
* Add the service Principal Names (SPN) directory property for an Active
Directory service account.
* Create the keytab file.
. Enable and configure the SPNEGO protocol on the {product-abbrev} server.
. Configure browsers

== Create the Kerberos Keytab File

An Active Directory service account is created in Domain for each mailstore
server.

. Create an Active Directory service account. This is the account used to
generate the Kerberos keytab file that is added to the Zimbra server.

.. Go to the Active Directory *Start > Programs > Administrative Tools >
Active Directory Users and Computers* console.

.. To create the service account, click the AD Domain name and from the
expanded content right-click *Users* and select *New > User*. Complete
the New Object – User dialog.
+
* *Full name*: Enter the user display name for the AC service
account.  Recommend that the full name be the {product-abbrev} mailbox server name. +
Example: *mail1*
+
* *User Logon Name*: This name is the value that is set for the
`zimbraSpnegoAuthTargetName` server attribute in LDAP. Write itdown. +
Example: *HTTP/mail1.example.com*
+
* *User Logon Name (pre-Windows2000):* This name is used for the
`–mapUser` parameter in the `setspn` and `ktpass` commands. +
Example: *mail1*
+
* Click *Next*.

.. Enter and confirm the password. This password is used for the
`–pass {AD-user-password}` parameter in the `ktpass` command,
configured below.

.. Check *Password never expires* and *User cannot change password*,
and click *Next*.

.. Click *Finish* to create the user. The service account name displays
in the Users directory.

. Use the `setspn` command to map the mailbox server name as the
service Principal Names (SPN) to the user account. The SPN is used in
the process of mutual authentication between the client and the server
hosting particular service.

..  From the command prompt, type `setspn –a {userlogonname} {serviceaccountname}`
+
.Map mailbox server name as servie Principal Names to user account
====
[source,bash]
----
setspn –a HTTP/mail1.example.com mail1
----
====

.. To verify that the SPN is registered, type `C:\>setspn –l \{accountname}` +
A list of registered SPNs is displayed.

. Create the keytab file used when signing into the Kerberos domain.  Use
the ktpass tool from the Windows Server toolkit to create the Kerberos
keytab.
+
[NOTE]
A Kerberos keytab file contains a list of keys that are analogous to user
passwords. Restrict and monitor permissions on any keytab files you create.
+
The command to type follows:
+
[source,bash]
----
ktpass -out {keytab-file-to-produce} -princ {Service-Principal-Name}@\{the-kerberos-realm} -mapUser {AD-user} -mapOp set -pass {AD-user-password} -crypto RC4-HMAC-NT -pType KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL
----
+
[cols="1m,4"]
|=======================================================================
|ktpass -out |
The key is written to this output file. +
Enter the directory location and keytab file name. The keytab file name is
`jetty.keytab`. +
For example, `C:\Temp\spengo\jetty.keytab`

|-princ |
This is the principal name. +
Enter the service Principal Name as used in *Step 2* in Setting up the
Microsoft Windows Active Directory Domain Controller section. +
For example, HTTP/mail1.example.com@COMPANY.COM

|-mapUser |
This maps `–princ` value to this user account. +
Enter the AD service account user name entered in the *User Logon Name
(pre-Windows2000)* set in *Step 1.b* in Setting up the Microsoft Windows
Active Directory Domain Controller section.

|-mapOp |
This sets the mapping. The value for this parameter is *set*

|-pass |
This is the password to use.

Enter the password entered in the *User Logon Name (pre-Windows2000)* set
in *Step 1.c* in Setting up the Microsoft Windows Active Directory Domain
Controller section.

|-crypto |
This is the cryptosystem to use. +
Enter *RC4-HMAC-NT*

|-pType |
Enter *KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL* +
To avoid warning messages from the toolkit enter this value.

|=======================================================================
+
.Using `ktpass` to create a jetty.keytab file
====
[source,bash]
----
ktpass -out C: \Temp\spengo\jetty.keytab -princ HTTP/mail1.example.com@COMPANY.COM -mapUser mail1 -mapOp set - pass password123 -crypto RC4-HMAC-NT -pType KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL
----

The command is confirmed with something similar to the example below.

----
Targeting domain controller: …

    Using legacy password setting method
    Successfully mappeped HTTP/mail1.example.com to mail1.
    Key created.
    Output keytab to c:\Temp\spengo\jetty.keytab:
    Keytab version: 0x502

    keysize 71 HTTP HTTP/mail1.example.com@COMPANY.COM ptype 1 (KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL) vno3 etype 0x17 (RC4-HMAC) keylength 16 (0xc383f6a25f1e195d5aef495c980c2bfe)
----
====

. Transfer the keytab file (jetty.keytab) to the Zimbra server. Copy
the file created in step 3 to the following Zimbra server location:
`/opt/zimbra/data/mailboxd/spnego/jetty.keytab`.

[IMPORTANT]
Do not rename the `jetty.keytab` file. This file name is referenced from
various configuration files.

Repeat steps 1 to 4 to create an create the keytab file (`jetty.keytab`)
for each Zimbra mailstore server.

== Configure {product-abbrev}

SPNEGO attributes in Global Config and on each Zimbra server are configured
and pre-authentication is set up for the domain. Use the zmprov commands to
modify the Zimbra server.

[NOTE]
Only one Kerberos REALM is supported per {product-abbrev} installation.

. Modify the following global config attributes, with the `zmprov mcf`
command.
+
[cols="1m,2",options=""]
|=======================================================================
|zimbraSpnegoAuthEnabled |Set to TRUE.

|zimbraSpnegoAuthErrorURL |
This is the URL users are redirected to when spnego auth fails. Setting it
to `/zimbra/?ignoreLoginURL=1` will redirect user to the regular Zimbra
login page, where user will be prompted for their zimbra user name and
password.

|zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm |
The Kerberos realm in the domain controller.

This is the domain name in the Active Directory. (COMPANY.COM)

|=======================================================================
+
To modify the global config attributes, type:

..  `zmprov mcf zimbraSpnegoAuthEnabled TRUE`

..  `zmprov mcf zimbraSpnegoAuthErrorURL '/zimbra/?ignoreLoginURL=1'`
..  `zmprov mcf zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm <COMPANY.COM>`

. On each Zimbra server, modify the following global config attributes with
the `zmprov ms` command.
+
[cols="1m,2",options="",]
|=======================================================================
|zimbraSpnegoAuthTargetName |
This is the user logon name from Step 1 B, User Logon Name.

|zimbraSpnegoAuthPrincipal |
Enter the user logon name set in `zimbraSpnegoAuthTargetName` and the
address set in global config `zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm`

Type as `zimbraSpnegoAuthTargetName@zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm`

For example, *HTTP/mail1.example.com@COMPANY.COM*

|=======================================================================
+
To modify the server global config attributes, type:
+
.. `zmprov ms mail1.example.com zimbraSpnegoAuthTargetName HTTP/mail1.example.com`
.. `zmprov ms mail1.example.com zimbraSpnegoAuthPrincipal HTTP/mail1.example.com@COMPANY.COM`

. The following is set up on the domain.
* Kerberos Realm
* Virtual host
* Web client login URL and UAs
* Web client logout URL and UAs

..  Set up Kerberos Realm for the domain. This is the same realm set in the
global config attribute `zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm`.  Type `zmprov md {domain}
zimbraAuthKerberos5Realm {kerberosrealm}`

..  Set up the virtual hosts for the domain. Virtual-hostname-* are
the hostnames you can browse to for the Zimbra Web Client UI. Type:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov md {domain} +zimbraVirtualHostname {virtual-hostname-1} +zimbraVirtualHostname {virtual-hostname-2}
...
----

.. Setup the web client log in URL and UAs allowed for the login URL on the domain.
+
** Set the login URL. The login URL is the URL to redirect users to when the
Zimbra auth token is expired. `zmprov md {domain} zimbraWebClientLoginURL
'../service/spnego'`
** Honor only supported platforms and browsers.
+
*zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA* is a multi-valued attribute,values
are regex. If this is not set, all UAs are allowed. If multiple values
are set, an UA is allowed as long as it matches any one of the values.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov md {domain} +zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA {UA-regex-1} +zimbraWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA {UA-regex-2} ...

[[configure_your_browser]]
== Configure Your Browser

When the SPNEGO SSO feature is enabled on your domain, user’s browsers must
be configured properly. Improperly configured browsers will behave
differently depending on the browser.

The following browsers are supported:

* For computers running Windows: Internet Explorer 6.0 or later, Firefox
3.0 or later, Chrome, Safari

* Apple Mac computer: Safari

. Firefox browser for computers running Windows

..  In Firefox browse to *about:config*. In the Firefox browser address
field, type *about:config*. The warning -- *This might void your warranty*, is
now displayed.
..  Click *I’ll be careful, I promise!*
..  Search in Filters, type *network.n*. Enter a comma-delimited list of
trusted domains or URLs.
+
Double-click *network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris*. Enter
*http://,https://*
+
Double-click *network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris*. Enter
*http://,https://*
+
_Or, to set specific URLs,_
+
Double-click *network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris*. Enter the domain
addresses. For example, http://mail1.example.com,https://
mail2.example.com
+
Double-click *network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris*. Enter the domain
addresses. For example, http://mail1.example.com,https://
mail2.example.com

. Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Safari for computers running Windows

.. In these browsers, go to *Tools > Internet Options > Security > Local
Intranet >Sites*. On the Sites dialog make sure all items are checked.

..  Select *Advanced*. Add the domain server (hostname) URL, both
http:// and https://
.. Click *OK* to close the file.
.. Go to *Tools > Options > Advanced > Security*. Locate and check
*Enable Integrated Windows Authentication*.

.. Click *OK* and close the browser.

. Safari for Apple Mac computers. No configuration is necessary.

== Test your setup

. On a Windows computer or an Apple Mac computer, log in to the
computer as a domain user.
+
Your ticket as a domain user will be saved on the computer. The token will
be picked up by the spnego-aware browser and sent in the Authorization
header to the Zimbra server.

. Browse to the Zimbra Web Client log on page.  You should be redirected to
your ZWC inbox without being prompted for user name and password.
+
If spnego auth fails, the user is redirected to an error URL.

== Troubleshooting setup

Make sure the following are true.

* The browser is in the Intranet zone.
* The user is accessing the server using a Hostname rather than IP
address.
* Integrated Windows authentication in Internet Explorer is enabled,
and the host is trusted in Firefox.
* The server is not local to the browser.
* The client’s Kerberos system is authenticated to a domain controller.

* If the browser display the "401 Unauthorized", it's most likely that the
browser either did not send another request with Authorization in response
to the 401, or had sent an Authorization which is not using the
GSS-API/SPNEGO scheme.
+
Check your browser settings, and make sure it is one of the supported
browsers/platforms

* If you are redirected to the error URL specified in
`zimbraSpnegoAuthErrorURL`, that means The SPNEGO authentication sequence
does not work.
+
Take a network trace, make sure the browser sends Authorization header in
response to the 401. Make sure the Negotiate is using GSS-API/ SPNEGO, not
NTLM (use a network packet decoder like Wireshark) .
+
After verifying that the browser is sending the correct Negotiate, if it
still does not work, turn on the following debug and check Zimbra logs:
+
--
** ADD "`-DDEBUG=true -Dsun.security.spnego.debug=all`" (note, not replace)
   to localconfig key `spnego_java_options`

** Add `log4j.logger.org.mortbay.log=DEBUG` in `log4j`
--
+
Then restart the mailbox server.
+
Browse to the debug snoop page:
http://{server}:{port}/spnego/snoop.jsp. See if you can access the
snoop.jsp
+
Check zmmailboxd.out and mailox.log for debug output.

** One of the errors at this stage could be because of clock skew on
thejetty server. If this is the case, it should be shown in
`zmmailboxd.out`. Fix the clock skew and try again.

== Configure Kerberos Auth with SPNEGO Auth

Kerberos auth and SPNEGO can co-exists on a domain. Use case is using
Kerberos as the mechanism for verifying user principal/password against a
KDC, instead of the native Zimbra LDAP, when user cannot get in by SPNEGO.

When SPNEGO auth fails, users are redirected to the Zimbra sign in page if
the browser is configured properly. Users can enter their Zimbra username
and password on the sign in page to sign in manually. The Domain attribute
`zimbraAuthMech` controls the mechanism for verifying passwords. If
`zimbraAuthMech` is set to "kerberos5", The user name the user enters is
usedto first identify a valid Zimbra user (users must be provisioned in the
Zimbra LDAP), then from Zimbra user is mapped to a Kerberos principal, the
Kerberos principal + password is then validated against a KDC. This KDC
could be different from, or the same as, the KDC that the Active Directory
domain controller (for SPNEGO auth) is running as.

[NOTE]
Every Microsoft Active Directory domain controller acts as Kerberos
KDC. For SPNEGO auth, KDC is not contacted from the mailbox server. The
Kerberos token sent from the Authorization http header along with jetty's
keytab file can identify/authenticate the user.

For kerberos auth (`zimbraAuthMech*="kerberos5"`), the mailbox server
needs to contact KDC to validate principal+password. For the java
kerberos client (i.e. Zimbra mailbox server), the default realm and KDC
for the realm is specify in a Kerberos config file. The location of this
config file can be specified in JVM argument `java.security.krb5.conf`.
If it is not specified, the default is `/etc/krb5.conf`. When SPNEGO is
enabled in Zimbra, `java.security.krb5.conf` for the mailbox server is
set to `/opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini`. Therefore, that is the
effective file for configuring kerberos auth.

`/opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini` is rewritten from
`/opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini.in` each time when the mailbox server
restarts. To configure, you need to modify the
`/opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini.in` file, not
`/opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini`.

Under [realms] section, kdc and admin_server are not set for SPNEGO auth,
but they are required for kerberos auth.

To configure:

. Edit /opt/zimbra/jetty/etc/krb5.ini.in
. Change:
----
[realms]
%%zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm%% = {
default_domain = %%zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm%%
}
----
to
----
%%zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm%% = {
             kdc = YOUR-KDC
             admin_server = YOUR-ADMIN-SERVER
             default_domain = %%zimbraSpnegoAuthRealm%%
}
----

. Replace YOUR-KDC and YOUR-ADMIN-SERVER to the hostname on which the
kdc/admin_server for kerberos auth is running.

. Save the file and restart mailbox server.

The restriction is the realm for SPNEGO and Kerberos auth must be the
same. For SPNEGO auth, the Kerberos principal in the Authorization header
is mapped to a unique Zimbra account. For Kerberos auth, the Zimbra account
is mapped to a unique Kerberos principal. The mapping (by domain attribute
`zimbraAuthKerberos5Realm`) is the same for both.

[[setting_up_single_sign_on_options_for_zco]]
== Setting Up Single Sign-On Options for ZCO

[NOTE]
To use SSO, SPNEGO must be configured on the {product-abbrev} server to use this option.

The single sign-on option works with a specific server. The server name
used in the ZCO profile must match that in the SPNEGO configuration.  Make
sure that the server name is incorporated into the `.msi` file prior to
installation.

To set up the single sign-on option in the `.msi` customization script:

.  Set the server name to be the server name configured for SPNEGO, enter
`-sn <spnegoserver.example.com>`.
.  Set the password rule, enter `-pw 0`

[source,bash]
----
cscript ZmCustomizeMsi.js <path/msi-filename> -sn <spnegoserver.example.com> -pw 0
