= Zimbra IMAPD Server
:toc:

The Zimbra IMAPD server is an optionally installed dedicated server that handles IMAP(S) traffic.
It can be installed on the same node as a *mailbox server* or on a separate node.
When installed on the same node as a *mailbox server* the mailbox's internal IMAPD process is disabled.

In installations which have very heavy IMAP usage it is the recommended practice to install IMAPD on separate nodes from the *mailbox* processes to allow for horizontal scaling of IMAPD resources independently from the mailbox nodes.
