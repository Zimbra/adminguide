= Zimbra Mailbox Server
:toc:

The Zimbra mailbox server is a dedicated server that manages all the
mailbox content, including messages, contacts, calendar, and
attachments.

The Zimbra mailbox server has dedicated volumes for backup and log
files. Each Zimbra mailbox server can see only its own storage volumes.
Zimbra mailbox servers cannot see, read, or write to another server.

== Mailbox Server

Each account is configured on one mailbox server, and this account is
associated with a mailbox that contains email messages, attachments,
calendar, contacts and collaboration files for that account.

Each mailbox server has its own standalone message store, data store,
and index store for the mailboxes on that server. The following is an
overview of each store and their directory location.

=== Message Store

All email messages are stored in MIME format in the Message Store,
including the message body and file attachments.

By default, the message store is located on each mailbox server under
`/opt/zimbra/store`. Each mailbox has its own directory named after its
internal mailbox ID. Mailbox IDs are unique per server, not system-wide.

Messages with multiple recipients are stored as a single -copy on the
message store. On UNIX systems, the mailbox directory for each user
contains a hard link to the actual file.

When {product-name} is installed, one index volume and one message
volume are configured on each mailbox server. Each mailbox is assigned to a
permanent directory on the current index volume. When a new message is
delivered or created, the message is saved in the current message volume.

To manage your email storage resources, you can configure storage
volumes for older messages by implementing a Hierarchical Storage
Management (HSM) policy.
See <<managing_configuration,Managing Configuration>>.

=== Data Store

The Data Store is a SQL database where internal mailbox IDs are
linked with user accounts. All the message metadata including tags,
conversations, and pointers indicate where the messages are stored in
the file system. The SQL database files are located in
`/opt/zimbra/db`.

Each account (mailbox) resides only on one server. Each server has its
own standalone data store containing data for the mailboxes on that
server.

* The data store maps the mailbox IDs to the users' LDAP
accounts. The primary identifier within the {product-name} database
is the mailbox ID, rather than a user name or account name. The mailbox
ID is only unique within a single mailbox server.
* Metadata including user's set of tag definitions, folders, contacts,
calendar appointments, tasks, Briefcase folders, and filter rules are in
the data store database.
* Information about each mail message, including whether it is read or
unread, and which tags are associated is stored in the data store
database.

=== Index Store

The index and search technology is provided through Apache Lucene. Each
email message and attachment is automatically indexed when the message
arrives. An index file is associated with each account. Index files are
located in `/opt/zimbra/index`.

The tokenizing and indexing process is not configurable by
administrators or users.

The process is as follows:

1.  The Zimbra MTA routes the incoming email to the mailbox server that
contains the account's mailbox.
2.  The mailbox server parses the message, including the header, the
body, and all readable file attachments such as PDF files or Microsoft
Word documents, in order to tokenize the words.
3.  The mailbox server passes the tokenized information to Lucene to
create the index files.

[NOTE]
Tokenization is the method for indexing by each word.  Certain common
patterns, such as phone numbers, email addresses, and domain names are
tokenized as shown in the Message Tokenization illustration.

== Web Application Server

The Jetty web application server runs web applications (webapps) on any
store server. It provides one or more web application services.

=== Mailstore Services

Mailstore services provides the back-end access to mailbox/account data.
Webapps for the mailstore include:

* Mailstore (mail server) = `/opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/service`
* Zimlets = `/opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimlet`

=== User Interface Services

User Interface services provide front-end user interface access to the
mailbox account data and Administration Console, including:

* {web-app-term}s = `/opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra`
* Zimbra administrator console = `/opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbraAdmin`
* Zimlets = `/opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimlet`

== Web Application Server Split

The Web Application Server Split functionality provides an option to
separate the mailstore services (mail server) and the user interface
services (web client server).

For example, a web client server running 'zimbra,zimbraAdmin' webapps
serving the static UI content like html/css pages, and mail server
running 'service' webapp serving all the SOAP requests. These servers
are running in split mode.

[IMPORTANT]
The {modern-client} does not currently support {product-short} Web Application Server Split configuration.

The Web Application Server Split benefits include:

* Splitting the web client server from the mail server makes the
customization process more agile, allowing the roll out of new or
updated web UI customization without having to restart the mail servers.
This means zero down time.
* If you want to customize the {product-short} {web-client} or Zimbra
Administration Console, you can take the web client server offline and
run customization or maintenance, while not having to take down the mail
server.
* The web client server is completely decoupled from mailbox accounts.
This means any web client server can service any account request.

=== Installation and Configuration of the Web Application Server Split

For installation and configuration of the Web Application Server Split,
see the {product-name} Multi-Server Installation Guide.

== Backing Up the Mailbox Server

{product-name} includes a configurable backup manager that resides on
every {product-name} server and performs both backup and restore
functions. You do not have to stop the {product-name} server in order
to run the backup process. The backup manager can be used to restore a
single user, rather than having to restore the entire system in the event
that one user's mailbox becomes corrupted. Full and incremental backups are
in `/opt/zimbra/backup`.
See <<backup_and_restore,Backup and Restore>>.

Each Zimbra mailbox server generates redo logs that contain current and
archived transactions processed by the message store server since the
last incremental backup. When the server is restored, after the backed
up files are fully restored, any redo logs in the archive and the
current redo log in use are replayed to bring the system to the point
before the failure.

== Mailbox Server Logs

A {product-name} deployment consists of various third-party
components with one or more mailbox servers. Each of the components may
generate its own logging output. Local logs are in `/opt/zimbra/log`.

Selected {product-name} log messages generate SNMP traps, which you
can capture using any SNMP monitoring software.
See <<monitoring_zcs_servers,Monitoring {product-short} Servers>>.

[NOTE]
System logs, redo logs, and backup sessions should be on separate disks to
minimize the possibility of unrecoverable data loss in the event that one
of those disks fails.
