= Managing Configuration
:toc:

The {product-abbrev} components are configured during the initial installation of the
software. After the installation, you can manage the following components
from either the Administration Console or using the CLI utility.

*Help* is available from the Administration Console about how to perform
tasks from the Administration Console. If the task is only available from
the CLI, see <<cli_commands,Zimbra CLI Commands>> for a description of how
to use the CLI utility.

== Global Configuration

Global Settings apply to all accounts in the Zimbra servers. They are
initially set during installation. You can modify the settings from the
Administration Console.

Configurations set in Global Settings define inherited default values
for the following objects: server, account, COS, and domain. If these
attributes are set in the server, the server settings override the
global settings.

Admin Console: ::
To configure global settings, navigate to: +
*Home > Configure > Global Settings*

Configured global settings are:

* Default domain
* Maximum number of results returned for GAL searches. Default = 100.
* User views of email attachments and attachment types not permitted.
* Configuration for authentication process, Relay MTA for external
delivery, DNS lookup, and protocol checks.
* Spam check controls and anti-virus options to check messages received.
* Free/busy scheduling across a mix of {product-name} servers and
third party email servers.
* Customization of themes: modify colors and add your logo.
* Configuration of company name display for external guest log on, when
viewing a shared Briefcase folder.
* Backup default directory and backup notification information.
* Global HSM schedule that defines when messages should be moved to a
secondary storage space.
* View of current Zimbra license information, license updating, and view
the number of accounts created.

[[general_information_configuration]]
== General Information Configuration

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings*

Use the *General Information* screen to view and set global parameters

[[attachments_confirguration]]
== Attachments Configuration

=== Setting Up Email Attachment Rules

Global email attachment settings allow you to specify global rules for
handling attachments to an email message. You can also set rules by COS and
for individual accounts. When attachment settings are configured in Global
Settings, the global rule takes precedence over COS and Account settings.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > Attachments*

[cols=","]
image:images/administration_console_email_attachment_rules.png[Attachment Rules] +
See
<<_blocking_email_attachments_by_file_type,Blocking Email Attachments by File type>>
for information about this section of the screen.

.Global Settings Advanced
[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|Attachments cannot be viewed regardless of COS |
Users cannot view any attachments. This global setting can be set to
prevent a virus outbreak from attachments, as no mail attachments can be
opened.

|Attachments are viewed in HTML regardless of COS |
Email attachments can only be viewed in HTML.  The COS may have another
setting but this global setting overrides the COS setting.

|Attachments are viewed according to COS |
This global setting states the COS sets the rules for how email attachments
are viewed

|Send blocked extension notification to recipient |

|=======================================================================


=== Blocking Email Attachments by File Type

You can also reject messages with certain types of files attached. You
select which file types are unauthorized from the *Common extensions*
list. You can also add other extension types to the list. Messages with
those type of files attached are rejected. By default the recipient and the
sender are notified that the message was blocked.

If you do not want to send a notification to the recipient when messages
are blocked, you can disable this option.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > Attachments*

[[mta_configuration]]
== MTA Configuration

Use options from the MTA page to enable or disable authentication and
configure a relay hostname, the maximum message size, enable DNS lookup,
protocol checks, and DNS checks.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > MTA*

image:images/administation_console_mta_configuration.png[MTA Configuration]

.MTA Page Options
[cols=",a"]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|Authentication |

* *Authentication* should be enabled, to support mobile SMTP authentication
users so that their email client can talk to the Zimbra MTA.

* *TLS authentication only* forces all SMTP auth to use Transaction Level
Security to avoid passing passwords in the clear.

|Network |

* *Web mail MTA Host name and Web mail MTA Port*. The MTA that the web
server connects to for sending mail. The default port number is 25.

* The *Relay MTA for external delivery* is the relay host name. This is the
Zimbra MTA to which Postfix relays non- local email.

* If your MX records point to a spam-relay or any other external non-Zimbra
server, enter the name of that server in the *Inbound SMTP host name*
field. This check compares the domain MX setting against the
+zimbraInboundSmtpHostname+ setting, if set. If this attribute is not set,
the domain MX setting is checked against +zimbraSmtpHostname+.

* MTA Trusted Networks. Configure trusted networks that are allowed to
relay mail. Specify a list of network addresses, separated by commas and/or
a space.

* If *Enable DNS lookups* is checked, the Zimbra MTA makes an explicit DNS
query for the MX record of the recipient domain. If this option is
disabled, set a relay host in the Relay MTA for external delivery.

* If *Allow domain administrators to check MX records
from Administration Console* is checked, domain
administrators can check the MX records for their domain.

|Milter Server |

* If *Enable Milter Server* is checked, the milter enforces the rules that
are set up for who can send email to a distribution list.

|Archiving |
* If you installed the Archiving feature, you can enable it Configuration
here.

|Messages |

* Set the *Maximum messages size* for a message and it's attachments that
can be sent.
+
[TIP]
To set the maximum size of an uploaded file to Briefcase, go to the General
Information page.

* You can enable the *X-Originating-IP header to messages* checkbox. The
+X-Originating-IP+ header information specifies the original sending IP of
the email message the server is forwarding.

|Policy Service |
* Customize *zimbraMtaRestriction* (restrictions to reject Checks some
suspect SMTP clients).

|Protocol checks |
* To reject unsolicited commercial email (UCE), for spam control.

|DNS checks |
* To reject mail if the client's IP address is unknown, the hostname in the
greeting is unknown, or if the sender's domain is unknown.

* Add other email recipient restrictions to the *List of RBLs* field.

[NOTE]
RBL (Real time black-hole lists) can be turned on or off from the Zimbra
CLI.

|=======================================================================

=== Global IMAP and POP Configuration

Use the IMAP and POP pages to enable global access.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > IMAP* +
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > POP*

[NOTE]
When you make changes to the IMAP or POP settings, you must restart
{product-name} before the changes take effect.

IMAP and POP3 polling intervals can be set from the Administration Console
COS Advanced page. +
Default = No polling interval.

[NOTE]
If IMAP/POP proxy is set up, ensure that the port numbers are configured
correctly.

With POP3, users can retrieve their mail stored on the Zimbra server and
download new mail to their computer. The user's POP configuration in their
*Preference > Mail* page determines how their messages are downloaded and
saved.

== Working With Domains

One domain is identified during the installation process. You can add
domains after installation. From the Administration Console you can manage
the following domain features.

* Global Address List
* Authentication
* Virtual hosts for the domain to establish a default domain for a user
login
* Public service host name that is used for REST URLs, commonly used in
sharing.
* Maximum number of accounts that can be created on the domain
* Free/Busy Interop settings for use with Microsoft Exchange.
* Domain SSL certificates

A domain can be renamed and all account, distribution list, alias and
resource addresses are changed to the new domain name. The CLI utility is
used to changing the domain name.
See <<_renaming_a_domain,Renaming a Domain>>.

[NOTE]
Domain settings override global settings.

=== Domain General Information Configuration

Use the *New Domain* Wizard to set options described in this section.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > 2 Set up Domain > 1. Create Domain...*

image:images/administration_console_create_domain.png[Create Domain]

.New Domain -- General Information
[cols=",a",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|Domain name * +
Public service host name |
Enter the host name of the REST URL. This is commonly used for sharing. See
<<_setting_up_a_public_service_host_name,Setting up a Public Service Host>>

|Public service protocol |
Select HTTP or HTTPS from the drop-down field.

|Public service port |

|Inbound SMTP host name |
If your MX records point to a spam-relay or any other external non-Zimbra
server, enter the name of the server here.

|Description |

|Default Class of Service |
This COS (for the domain) is automatically assigned to accounts created on
the domain if another COS is not set.

|Status |
The domain status is active in the normal state. Users can log in and mail
is delivered. Changing the status can affect the status for accounts on the
domain also. The domain status is displayed on the *Domain > General*
page. Domain status can be set as follows:

* *Active*. Active is the normal status for domains. Accounts can be created
and mail can be delivered.
+
--
[NOTE]
If an account has a different status setting than the domain setting, the
account status overrides the domain status.
--

* *Closed*. When a domain status is marked as closed,Login for accounts on
the domain is disabled and messages are bounced. The closed status
overrides an individual account's status setting.

* *Locked*. When a domain status is marked as locked,users cannot log in to
check their email, but email is still delivered to the accounts.  If an
account's status setting is marked as maintenance or closed, the account's
status overrides the domain status setting.

* *Maintenance*. When the domain status is markedas maintenance, users
cannot log in and their email is queued at the MTA. If an account's status
setting is marked as closed, the account's status overrides the domain
status setting.

* *Suspended*. When the domain status is marked assuspended, users cannot
log in, their email is queued at the MTA, and accounts and distribution
lists cannot be created, deleted, or modified. If an account's status
setting is marked as closed, the account's status overrides the domain
status setting.
|=======================================================================

==== Setting up a Public Service Host Name

You can configure each domain with the public service host name to be used
for REST URLs. This is the URL that is used when sharing email folders and
Briefcase folders, as well as sharing task lists, address books, and
calendars.

When users share a {product-name} folder, the default is to create
the URL with the Zimbra server hostname and the Zimbra service host
name. This is displayed as
*https://server.domain.com/service/home/username/sharedfolder*. The
attributes are generated as follows:

* Hostname is server.zimbraServiceHostname
* Protocol is determined from server.zimbraMailMode
* Port is computed from the protocol

When you configure a public service host name, this name is used instead of
the server/service name, as
*https://publicservicename.domain.com/home/username/sharedfolder*. The
attributes to be used are:

* +zimbraPublicServiceHostname+
* +zimbraPublicServiceProtocol+
* +zimbraPublicServicePort+

You can use another FQDN as long as the name has a proper DNS entry to
point at 'server' both internally and externally.

=== Global Address List (GAL) Mode Configuration

The Global Address List (GAL) is your company-wide listing of users that is
available to all users of the email system. GAL is a commonly used feature
in mail systems that enables users to look up another user's information by
first or last name, without having to know the complete email address.

GAL is configured on a per-domain basis. The GAL mode setting for each
domain determines where the GAL lookup is performed.

Use the *GAL Mode Settings* tool with your domain configuration to define
the Global Address List.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > 2 Set up Domain > 1 Create Domain... -> GAL Mode Settings*

image:images/administration_console_gal.png[GAL Mode Settings]

.New Domain -- GAL Mode Settings
[cols=",a",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|GAL Mode |

* *Internal*. The Zimbra LDAP server is used for directory lookups.

* *External*. External directory servers are used for GAL lookups. You can
configure multiple external LDAP hosts for GAL. All other directory
services use the Zimbra LDAP service (configuration, mail routing, etc.).
When you configure an external GAL, you can configure different search
settings and sync settings. You might want to configure different search
settings if your LDAP environment is set up to optimize LDAP searching by
setting up an LDAP cache server, but users also will need to be able to
sync to the GAL.

* *Both*. Internal and external directory
servers are used
for GAL lookups.

|Most results returned by GAL search |
Maximum number of search results that can be returned in one GAL search.
If this value is undefined here, the system will use the value defined in
Global Settings. +
Default = 100 results.

|GAL sync account name* |
Read-only field that displays the galsync name and associated domain.

|Datasource name for internal GAL |
Read-only field that displays the name of the internal GAL.

|Internal GAL polling interval |
Define how often -- as days, hours, minutes, or seconds -- the GAL sync
account is to sync with the LDAP server.  With the first sync to the LDAP
server, all GAL contacts from the LDAP are added to the galsync account's
address book. On subsequent syncs, the account is updated with information
about new contacts, modified contacts, and deleted contacts.

|=======================================================================

=== Using GAL sync accounts for faster access to GAL

A GAL sync account is created for the domain when an internal or external
GAL is created, and if you have more than one mailbox server, you can
create a GAL sync account for each mailbox server in the domain.  Using the
GAL sync account gives users faster access to auto complete names from the
GAL.

When a GAL sync account is created on a server, GAL requests are directed
to the server's GAL sync account instead of the domain's GAL sync
account. The GalSyncResponse includes a token which encodes the GAL sync
account ID and current change number. The client stores this and then uses
it in the next GalSyncRequest. Users perform GAL sync with the GAL sync
account they initially sync with. If a GALsync account is not available for
some reason, the traditional LDAP-based search is run.

[NOTE]
The GAL sync accounts are system accounts and do not use a Zimbra license.

When you configure the GAL sync account, you define the GAL datasource and
the contact data is syncd from the datasource to the GAL sync accounts'
address books. If the mode *Both* is selected, an address book is created
in the account for each LDAP data source.

The GAL polling interval for the GAL sync determines how often the GALsync
account syncs with the LDAP server. The sync intervals can be in x days,
hours, minutes, or seconds. The polling interval is set for each data
source.

When the GAL sync account syncs to the LDAP directory, all GAL contacts
from the LDAP are added to the address book for that GAL. During the sync,
the address book is updated with new contact, modified contact and deleted
contact information. You should not modify the address book directly. When
the LDAP syncs the GAL to the address book, changes you made directly to
the address book are deleted.

You create GALsync accounts from the Administration Console. The CLI
associated with this feature is *zmgsautil.*

==== Creating Additional GALsync Accounts

When {product-abbrev} is configured with more than one server, you can add an additional
GAL sync account for each server.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Domains*

. Select the domain to add another GAL sync account.

. In the *Gear* icon, select *Configure GAL*.

. Click *Add a GAL account*.

. In the GAL sync account name field, enter the name for this account.  Do
not use the default name.

. Select the mailbox server that this account will apply to.

. Enter the *GAL datasource name*, If the GAL mode is BOTH, enter the data
source name for both the internal GAL and the external GAL.

. Set the *GAL polling interval* to how often the GAL sync account should
sync with the LDAP server to update.

. Click *Finish*.

==== Changing GAL sync account name

The default name for the GAL sync account is *galsync*. When you configure
the GAL mode, you can specify another name. After the GAL sync account is
created, you cannot rename the account because syncing the data fails.

To change the account name delete the existing GAL sync account and
configure a new GAL for the domain.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Domains*

. Select the domain where you want to change the GAL sync account name.

. In the *Gear* icon, select *Configure GAL* to open the configuration wizard
and change the GAL mode to internal. Do not configure any other
fields. Click *Finish*.

. In the domain's account Content pane, delete the domain's galsync
account.

. Select the domain again and select Configure GAL to reconfigure the
GAL. In the GAL sync account name field, enter the name for the account.
Complete the GAL configuration and click *Finish*. The new account is
displayed in the Accounts Content pane.

=== Authentication Modes

Authentication is the process of identifying a user or a server to the
directory server and granting access to legitimate users based on user name
and password information provided when users log in.

Set the authentication method on a per-domain basis.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > 2 Set up Domain > 1 Create Domain... -> Authentication Mode*

.New Domain -- Authentication Mode
[cols=",a",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description


|Authentication mechanism |
* *Internal*. The Internal authentication uses the Zimbra directory server
for authentication on the domain.  When you select Internal, no other
configuration is required.

* *External LDAP*. The user name and password is theauthentication
information supplied in the bind operation to the directory server. You
must configure the LDAP URL, LDAP filter, and to use DN password to bind to
the external server.

* *External Active Directory*. The user name and password is the
authentication information supplied to the Active Directory server. You
identify the Active Directory domain name and URL.


|=======================================================================

=== Virtual Hosts

Virtual hosting allows you to host more than one domain name on a
server. The general domain configuration does not change.

When you create a virtual host, this becomes the default domain for a
user login. Zimbra Web Client users can log in without having to specify
the domain name as part of their user name.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > 2 Set up Domain > 1 Create Domain... -> Virtual Hosts*

.New Domain -- Virtual Hosts
[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|*Option* |*Description*

|Add virtual host |
Alphanumeric string to identify the virtual host(s) for this domain. The
virtual host requires a valid DNS configuration with an A record.  To
delete a virtual host from the domain, click *Remove* alongside the host name
displayed in this wizard screen.

|=======================================================================

To open the Zimbra Web Client log in page, users enter the virtual host
name as the URL address. For example, *https://mail.company.com*.

When the Zimbra login screen displays, users enter only their user name
and password. The authentication request searches for a domain with that
virtual host name. When the virtual host is found, the authentication is
completed against that domain.

=== Setting Account Limits

You can limit the number of accounts that can be provisioned on a
domain. The maximum number of accounts that can be provisioned for the
domain can be set when the domain is created. You can also edit the domain
configuration to add or change the number.

In the Administration Console this is set for a domain in the Account
Limits page. If this page is not configured, no limits on the domain are
set.

Resources, spam, and ham accounts are not counted against this limit.

[NOTE]
You cannot exceed the account limit set by the {product-name}
license.

When multiple Classes of Service (COS) are available, you can select which
classes of service can be configured and how many accounts on the domain
can be assigned to the COS. This is configured in the domain's Account
Limits page. The number of COS account types used is tracked.  The limits
for all COSs cannot exceed the number set for the maximum accounts for the
domain.

The number of COS assigned to accounts is tracked. You can see the number
assigned/number remaining from any account's General Information page.

=== Renaming a Domain

When you rename a domain you are actually creating a new domain, moving all
accounts to the new domain and deleting the old domain. All account, alias,
distribution list, and resource addresses are changed to the new domain
name. The LDAP is updated to reflect the changes.

Before you rename a domain

* Make sure MX records in DNS are created for the new domain name
* Make sure you have a functioning and current full backup of the domain

After the domain has been renamed

* Update external references that you have set up for the old domain name
to the new domain name. This may include automatically generated emails
that were sent to the administrator's mailbox such as backup ses-sion
notifications. Immediately run a full backup of the new domain

[source,bash]
----
zmprov -l rd [olddomain.com] [newdomain.com]
----

==== Domain Rename Process

When you run this `zmprov` command, the domain renaming process goes
through the following steps:

. The status of the old domain is changed to an internal status of
shutdown, and mail status of the domain is changed to suspended. Users
cannot login, their email is bounced by the MTA, and accounts, calendar
resources and distribution lists cannot be created, deleted or modified.
. The new domain is created with the status of shutdown and the mail status
suspended.
. Accounts, calendar resources, distribution lists, aliases, and resources
are all copied to the new domain.
. The LDAP is updated to reflect the new domain address.
. The old domain is deleted.
. The status for the new domain is changed to active. The new domain can
start accepting email messages.

=== Adding a Domain Alias

A domain alias allows different domain names to direct to a single domain
address. For example, your domain is domain.com, but you want users to have
an address of example.com, you can create example.com as the alias for the
domain.com address. Sending mail to user@example.com is the same as sending
mail to user@domain.com.

[NOTE]
A domain alias is a domain name just like your primary domain name. You
must own the domain name and verify your ownership before you can add it as
an alias.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Domains*, from the *Gear* icon select, *Add a Domain Alias*.

=== Enabling Support for Domain Disclaimers

Disclaimers are set per-domain. When upgrading, an existing global
disclaimer is converted to domain specific disclaimers on every domain to
preserve behavior with previous releases.

Per domain disclaimer support can be enabled using the following steps:

. Create a new domain (e.g. example.com) and account (e.g.
user2@example.com).
+
[source,bash]
----
$ zmprov cd example.com cb9a4846-6df1-4c18-8044-4c1d4c21ccc5
$ zmprov ca user2@example.com test123 95d4caf4-c474-4397-83da-aa21de792b6a
$ zmprov -l gaa user1@example.com user2@example.com
----

. Enable the use of disclaimers
+
[source,bash]
----
$ zmprov mcf zimbraDomainMandatoryMailSignatureEnabled TRUE
$ zmprov gcf zimbraDomainMandatoryMailSignatureEnabled
zimbraDomainMandatoryMailSignatureEnabled: TRUE
----

. Add disclaimers to the new domain
+
[source,bash]
----
$ zmprov md example.com
zimbraAmavisDomainDisclaimerText "text disclamer"
zimbraAmavisDomainDisclaimerHTML "HTML disclaimer"

$ zmprov gd example.com zimbraAmavisDomainDisclaimerText zimbraAmavisDomainDisclaimerHTML
# name example.com
zimbraAmavisDomainDisclaimerHTML: HTML disclaimer
zimbraAmavisDomainDisclaimerText: text disclamer

$ zmprov gd eng.example.com
# name eng.example.com
zimbraAmavisDomainDisclaimerText
zimbraAmavisDomainDisclaimerHTML
----

..  On the first MTA:
+
[source,bash]
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmaltermimeconfig -e example.com

Enabled disclaimers for domain: example.comm
Generating disclaimers for domain example.com.
----

..  On all additional MTAs:
+
--
[source,bash]
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmaltermimeconfig
----
* To test, send an email from the account (e.g. user2@example.com) in
html and plain text format

* To verify, check emails received with correct HTML disclaimer and
plain text disclaimer.

* To disable for the domain example.com
+
. On the first MTA, as the Zimbra user:
+
[source,bash]
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmaltermimeconfig -d example.com
----
+
.  On all additional MTAs:
+
[source,bash]
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmaltermimeconfig
----
--

=== Disabling Disclaimers for Intra-domain Emails

You can enable the option for emails between individuals in the same domain
to not have a disclaimer attached.

Set the attribute `attachedzimbraAmavisOutboundDisclaimersOnly` to `TRUE`.

To preserve backward-compatibility, this attribute defaults to `FALSE`.

=== Disabling the Disclaimer Feature

It is possible to completely remove support for disclaimers by setting the
related attribute to `FALSE`.

[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraDomainMandatoryMailSignatureEnabled FALSE
----

=== Zimlets on the Domain

All Zimlets that are deployed are displayed in the domain's *Zimlets*
page. If you do not want all the deployed Zimlets made available for users
on the domain, select from the list the Zimlets that are available for the
domain. This overrides the Zimlet settings in the COS or for an account.

== Managing Server Settings

A server is a machine that has one or more of the Zimbra service packages
installed. During the installation, the Zimbra server is automatically
registered on the LDAP server.

In the Administration Console, you can view the current status of all the
servers that are configured with Zimbra software, and you can edit or
delete existing server records. You cannot add servers directly to
LDAP. The {product-name} installation program must be used to add new
servers because the installer packages are designed to register the new
host at the time of installation.

The server settings that can be viewed from the Administration Console,
Configure Servers link for a specific server include:

* General information about the service host name, and LMTP advertised name
and bind address, and the number of threads that can simultane-ously
process data source imports.

* A list of enabled services. You can disable and enable the services.

* Authentication types enabled for the server, setting a Web mail MTA
host-name different from global. Setting relay MTA for external delivery,
and enabling DNS lookup if required. Enable the Milter Server and set the
bind address.

* Enabling POP and IMAP and setting the port numbers for a server. If
IMAP/POP proxy is set up, making sure that the port numbers are configured
correctly.

* Index and message volumes configuration. Setting HSM policies.

* IP Address Bindings. If the server has multiple IP addresses, IP Address
binding allows you to specify which interface to bind to.

* Proxy settings if proxy is configured.

* Backup and Restore configuration for the server. When backup and restore
is configured for the server, this overrides the global backup and restore
setting.

Servers inherit global settings if those values are not set in the server
configuration. Settings that can be inherited from the Global configuration
include MTA, SMTP, IMAP, POP, anti-virus, and anti-spam configurations.

=== General Server Settings

The General Information page includes the following configuration
information:

* Server display name and a description field

* Server hostname

* LMTP information including advertised name, bind address, and number of
threads that can simultaneously process data source imports. +
Default = 20 threads.

* Purge setting. The server manages the message purge schedule. You
configure the duration of time that the server should "rest" between
purg-ing mailboxes from the Administration Console, Global settings or
Server settings, or General Information page. +
Default = message purge is scheduled to run each minute.

When installing a reverse proxy the communication between the proxy server
and the backend mailbox server must be in plain text. Checking *This server
is a reverse proxy lookup target* automatically sets the following
parameters:

----
zimbraImapCleartextLoginEnabled TRUE
zimbraReverseProxyLookupTarget TRUE
zimbraPop3CleartextLoginEnabled TRUE
----

The Notes text box can be used to record details you want to save.

=== Change MTA Server Settings

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Servers -> _server_ -> MTA*

The *MTA* page show the following settings:

* Authentication enabled.
+
Enables SMTP client authentication, so users can authenticate. Only
authenticated users or users from trusted networks are allowed to relay
mail. TLS authentication when enabled, forces all SMTP auth to use
Transport Layer Security (successor to SSL) to avoid passing passwords in
the clear.

* Network settings, including Web mail MTA hostname, Web mail MTA time-out,
the relay MTA for external delivery, MTA trusted networks ID, and the
ability to enable DNS lookup for the server.

* Milter Server.
+
If *Enable Milter Server* is checked, the milter enforces the rules that
are set up for who can send email to a distribution list on the server.

=== Setting Up IP Address Binding

If the server has multiple IP addresses, you can use IP address binding
to specify which specific IP addresses you want a particular server to
bind to.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Servers -> _server_ -> IP Address Bindings*

.IP Address Bindings

=== Managing SSL Certificates for {product-abbrev}

A certificate is the digital identity used for secure communication between
different hosts or clients and servers. Certificates are used to certify
that a site is owned by you.

Two types of certificates can be used - self-signed and commercial
certificates.

* A *self-signed certificate* is an identity certificate that is signed by
its own creator.
+
You can use the Certificate Installation Wizard to generate a new
self-signed certificate. This is useful when you use a self-signed
certificate and want to change the expiration date. Self-signed
certificates are normally used for testing. +
Default = 1825 days (5 years)

* A *commercial certificate* is issued by a certificate authority (CA) that
attests that the public key contained in the certificate belongs to the
organi-zation (servers) noted in the certificate.

When {product-name} Server is installed, the self-signed certificate is
automatically installed and can be used for testing {product-name}
Server. You should install the commercial certificate when {product-name}
Server is used in your production environment.

[IMPORTANT]
ZCO users in a self-signed environment will encounter warnings about
connection security unless the root CA certificate is added to the client's
Window Certificate Store. See the
https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Main_Page[Zimbra Wiki] article
https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/ZCO_Connection_Security[ZCO Connection
Security] for more information.

=== Installing Certificates

To generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) you complete a form
with details about the domain, company, and country, and then generate
a CSR with the RSA private key.  You save this file to your computer
and submit it to your commercial certificate authorizer.

To obtain a commercially signed certificate, use the Zimbra Certificates
Wizard in the Administration Console to generate the RSA Private Key and
CSR.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > 1 Get Started > 3. Install Certificates*

Use guidelines from the Install Certificates table to set parameters for
your certificates.

.Install Certificates
[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|Common Name (CN) |
Exact domain name that should be used to access your Web site securely.
Are you going to use a wildcard common name?  If you want to manage
multiple sub domains on a single domain on the server with a single
certificate, check this box. An asterisk (*) is added to the Common Name
field.

|Country Name \(C) |
County name you want the certificate to display as our company location

|State/Province (ST) |
State/province you want the certificate to display as your company
location.

|City (L) |
City you want the certificate to display as your company location.

|Organization Name (O) |
Your company name

|Organization Unit (OU) |
Unit name (if applicable)

|Subject Alternative Name (SAN) |
If you are going to use a SAN, the input must be a valid domain name. When
SAN is used, the domain name is compared with the common name and then to
the SAN to find a match. You can create multiple SANs.  When the alternate
name is entered here, the client ignores the common name and tries to match
the server name to one of the SAN names.

|=======================================================================


Download the CSR from the Zimbra server and submit it to a Certificate
Authority, such as VeriSign or GoDaddy. They issue a digitally signed
certificate.

When you receive the certificate, use the Certificates Wizard a second time
to install the certificate on the {product-name}. When the
certificate is installed, you must restart the server to apply the
certificate.

=== Viewing Installed Certificates

You can view the details of certificates currently deployed. Details
include the certificate subject, issuer, validation days and subject
alternative name.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Certificates -> _zmhostname_*

Certificates display for different Zimbra services such as LDAP, mailboxd, MTA and proxy.

=== Maintaining Valid Certificates

It is important to keep your SSL certificates valid to ensure clients and
environments work properly, as the {product-abbrev} system can become non-functional if
certificates are allowed to expire. You can view deployed SSL certificates
from the {product-abbrev} administrator console, including their validation days. It is
suggested that certificates are checked periodically, so you know when they
expire and to maintain their validity.

=== Install a SSL Certificate for a Domain

You can install an SSL certificate for each domain on a {product-name}
server. Zimbra Proxy must be installed on {product-name} and correctly
configured to support multiple domains. For each domain, a virtual host
name and Virtual IP address are configured with the virtual domain name and
IP address.

Each domain must be issued a signed commercial certificate that attests
that the public key contained in the certificate belongs to that domain.

Configure the Zimbra Proxy Virtual Host Name and IP Address.
[source,bash]
----
zmprov md <domain> +zimbraVirtualHostName {domain.example.com} +zimbraVirtualIPAddress {1.2.3.4}
----

[NOTE]
The virtual domain name requires a valid DNS configuration with an A
record.

Edit the certificate for the domain:

Admin Console: ::
*Home > 1 Get Started > 3. Install Certificates*

Copy the domain's issued signed commercial certificate's and private key
files to the *Domain Certificate* section for the selected domain.

image:images/certificate_domain_load.jpg[Certificate Domain Load]

. Copy the root certificate and the intermediate certificates in descending
order, starting with your domain certificate. This allows the full
certificate chain to be validated.

. Remove any password (passphrase) from the private key before the
certificate is saved.
+
See your commercial certificate provider for details about how to remove
the password.

. Click *Upload*.
+
The domain certificate is deployed to `/opt/zimbra/conf/domaincerts`

== Using DKIM to Authenticate Email Message

Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level authentication
mechanism that lets your organization take responsibility for transmitting
an email message in a way that can be verified by a recipient. Your
organization can be the originating sending site or an intermediary. Your
organization's reputation is the basis for evaluating whether to trust the
message delivery.

You can add a DKIM digital signature to outgoing email messages,
associating the message with a domain name of your organization. You can
enable DKIM signing for any number of domains that are being hosted by
{product-abbrev}. It is not required for all domains to have DKIM signing enabled for
the feature to work.

DKIM defines an authentication mechanism for email using

* A domain name identifier
* Public-key cryptography
* DNS-based public key publishing service.

The DKIM signature is added to the email message header field. The header
information is similar to the following example.

----
DKIM-Signature a=rsa-sha1; q=dns;
     d=example.com;
     i=user@eng.example.com;
     s=jun2005.eng; c=relaxed/simple;
     t=1117574938; x=1118006938;
     h=from:to:subject:date;
     b=dzdVyOfAKCdLXdJOc9G2q8LoXSlEniSbav+yuU4zGeeruD00lszZVoG4ZHRNiYzR
----

Receivers who successfully validate a DKIM signature can use information
about the signer as part of a program to limit spam, spoofing, phising, or
other undesirable behavior.

=== Configure {product-name} for DKIM Signing

DKIM signing to outgoing mail is done at the domain level.

To set up DKIM you must run the CLI zmdkimkeyutil to generate the DKIM keys
and selector. You then update the DNS server with the selector which is the
public key.

. Log in to the {product-abbrev} server and as zimbra:
+
[source,bash]
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmdkimkeyutil -a -d <example.com>
----
+
The public DNS record data that must be added for the domain to your DNS
server is displayed. The public key DNS record appears as a DNS TXT-record
that must be added for the domain to your DNS server.
+
Optional. To specify the number of bits for the new key, include `*-b*` in
the command line, `-b <\####>`. If you do not add the `-b`, the default
setting is 2048 bits.
+
----

----
+
The generated DKIM data is stored in the LDAP server as part of the
domain LDAP entry.

. Work with your service provider to update your DNS for the domain with
the DKIM DNS text record.

. Reload the DNS and verify that the DNS server is returning the DNS
record.

. Verify that the public key matches the private key, See the
<<dkim_identifiers,Identifiers>> table for `-d`, `-s`, and `-x`
descriptions.

=== Update DKIM Data for a Domain

When the DKIM keys are updated, the DNS server must be reloaded with the
new TXT record.

Good practice is to leave the previous TXT record in DNS for a period of
time so that email messages that were signed with the previous key can
still be verified.

Log in to the {product-abbrev} server and as zimbra:
[source,bash]
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmdkimkeyutil -u -d <example.com>
----

Optional. To specify the number of bits for the new key, include *-b* in
the command line, `-b <\####>`. If you do not add the `-b`, the default
setting is 2048 bits.

. Work with your service provider to update your DNS for the domain with
the DKIM DNS text record.

. Reload the DNS and verify that the DNS server is returning the DNS
record.

. Verify that the public key matches the private key: See the Identifiers
table for `-d`, `-s`, and `-x` descriptions.
+

----

=== Remove DKIM Signing from {product-abbrev}

Removing DKIM signing deletes the DKIM data from LDAP. New email message no
longer are signed for the domain. When you remove DKIM from the domain,
good practice is to leave the previous TXT record in DNS for a period of
time so that email messages that were signed with the previous key can
still be verified.

Use the following command syntax to remove the file:
[source,bash]
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmdkimkeyutil -r -d example.com
----

=== Retrieve DKIM Data for a Domain

Use the following command syntax to view the stored DKIM information for
the domain, selector, private key, public signature and identity:
[source,bash]
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmdkimkeyutil -q -d example.com
----

== Anti-spam Settings

{product-abbrev} uses SpamAssassin to control spam. SpamAssassin uses predefined rules
as well as a Bayes database to score messages. Zimbra evaulates spaminess
based on percentage. Messages tagged between 33%-75% are considered spam
and delivered to the user's junk folder. Messages tagged above 75% are not
sent to the user and are discarded.

You can change the anti-spam settings.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > AS/AV*

image:images/as_av.jpg[Anti-Spam Settings]

. At the Anti-Spam fields, enter parameters, as appropriate for your
requirements.

. From the *Gear* icon, select *Save* to use your settings.
+
--
.Anti-Spam
[cols="1,2",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|Kill percent |
Percent that scored mail to be considered as spam, and therefore not to be
delivered. +
Default = 75%

|Tag percent |
Percent that scores mail to be considered as spam, which should be
delivered to the Junk folder. +
Default = 33%

|Subject prefix |
Text string to be added to the subject line, for messages tagged as spam.

|=======================================================================
--

When a message is tagged as spam, the message is delivered to the
recipient's junk folder. Users can view the number of unread messages that
are in their junk folder and can open the junk folder to review the
messages marked as spam. If you have the anti-spam training filters
enabled, when users add or remove messages in the junk folder, their action
helps train the spam filter.

RBL (Real time black-hole lists) can be turned on or off in SpamAssassin
from the Zimbra CLI.

=== Anti-Spam Training Filters

The automated spam training filter is enabled by default and two
feedback system mailboxes are created to receive mail notification.

* *Spam Training User* for mail that was not marked as spam but should be.

* *Non-spam (referred to as ham) training user* for mail that was marked
asspam but should not have been.

The mailbox quota and attachment indexing is disabled for these training
accounts. Disabling quotas prevents bouncing messages when the mailbox is
full.

How well the anti-spam filter works depends on recognizing what is
considered spam. The SpamAssassin filter learns from messages that users
specifically mark as spam by sending them to their junk folder or not spam
by removing them from their junk folder. A copy of these marked messages is
sent to the appropriate spam training mailbox.

When {product-abbrev} is installed, the spam/ham cleanup filter is configured on only
the first MTA. The {product-abbrev} spam training tool, *zmtrainsa*, is configured to
automatically retrieve these messages and train the spam filter. The
*zmtrainsa script* is enabled through a crontab job to feed mail to the
SpamAssassinapplication, allowing SpamAssassin to 'learn' what signs are
likely to mean spam or ham. The zmtrainsa script empties these mailboxes
each day.

[NOTE]
--
New installs of {product-abbrev} limit spam/ham training to the first MTA installed. If
you uninstall or move this MTA, you will need to enable spam/ham training
on another MTA, as one host should have this enabled to run `zmtrainsa
--cleanup`.

To set this on a new MTA server

[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -e zmtrainsa_cleanup_host=TRUE
----
--

=== Disabling the Spam Training Mailboxes

The {product-abbrev} default is that all users can give feedback when they add or remove
items from their junk folder.

If you do not want users to train the spam filter you can disable this
function.

. Modify the global configuration attributes, `ZimbraSpamIsSpamAccount` and
`ZimbraSpamIsNotSpamAccount`

. Remove the account addresses from the attributes.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf ZimbraSpamIsSpamAccount ''
zmprov mcf ZimbraSpamIsNotSpamAccount ''
----

When these attributes are modified, messages marked as spam or not spam are
not copied to the spam training mailboxes.

=== Manually Training Spam Filters

Initially, you might want to train the spam filter manually to quickly
build a database of spam and non-spam tokens, words, or short character
sequences that are commonly found in spam or ham. To do this, you can
manually forward messages as message/rfc822 attachments to the spam and
non-spam mailboxes.

When `zmtrainsa` runs, these messages are used to teach the spam filter.
Make sure you add a large enough sampling of messages to get accurate
scores. To determine whether to mark messages as spam at least 200 known
spams and 200 known hams must be identified.

=== Protect Alias Domains from Backscatter Spam

To reduce the risk of backscatter spam, you can run a service that runs a
Zimbra Access Policy Daemon that validates *RCPT To:* content specifically
for alias domains.

[NOTE]
For information about creating domain aliases, see the
https://wiki.zimbra.com[Zimbra wiki] article
https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Managing_Domains[Managing Domains].

. Set the Postfix LC key.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -e postfix_enable_smtpd_policyd=yes
----

. Define the MTA restriction.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf +zimbraMtaRestriction "check_policy_service unix:private/policy"
----

The `postfix_policy_time_limit` key is set because by default the Postfix
spawn(8) daemon kills its child process after 1000 seconds. This is too
short for a policy daemon that might run as long as an SMTP client is
connected to an SMTP process.

=== Disabling Postfix Policy Daemon

Disable the SMTPD policy.
[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -e postfix_enable_smtpd_policyd=no
----

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > MTA*

Define the policy restriction.Setting Email Recipient
RestrictionsRealtimeBlackhole Lists and Realtime Right-Hand Side
Blocking/Black Lists can be turned on or off in the MTA.

For protocol checks, the following three RBLs can be enabled:

* tname

* Client must greet with a fully qualified hostname -
  `reject_non_fqdn_hostname`

* Sender address must be fully qualified - reject_non_fqdn_sender

Hostname in greeting violates RFC - `reject_invalid_host`
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf -zimbraMtaRestriction "check_policy_service unix:private/policy"

* `reject_rbl_client cbl.abuseat.org`
* `reject_rbl_client bl.spamcop.net`
* `reject_rbl_client dnsbl.sorbs.net`
* `reject_rbl_client sbl.spamhaus.org`

As part of recipient restrictions, you can also use the
`reject_rbl_client <rbl hostname>` option.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > MTA -> DNS Checks*

Use the DNS tools in MTA configuration to define the restriction lists.

=== Setting Global Rule for Messages Marked as Both Spam and Whitelist

When you use a third-party application to filter messages for spam before
messages are received by {product-abbrev}, the {product-abbrev} global rule is to send all messages
that are marked by the third-party as spam to the junk folder. This
includes messages that are identified as spam and also identified as
whitelisted.

If you do not want messages that are identified as whitelisted to be sent
to the junk folder, you can configure `zimbraSpamWhitelistHeader` and
`zimbraSpamWhitelistHeaderValue` to pass these messages to the user's
mailbox. This global rule is not related to the Zimbra MTA spam filtering
rules. Messages are still passed through a user's filter rules.

To search the message for a whitelist header:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraSpamWhitelistHeader <X-Whitelist-Flag>
----

To set the value:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraSpamWhitelistHeaderValue <value_of_third-party_white-lists_messages>
----

== Anti-virus Settings

Anti-virus protection is enabled for each server when the Zimbra software
is installed. The anti-virus software is configured to send messages that
have been identified as having a virus to the virus quarantine mailbox. An
email notification is sent to recipients letting them know that a message
has been quarantined. The quarantine mailbox message lifetime is set to 7
days.

From the Admin Console, you can specify ho aggressively spam is to be
filtered in your {product-name}.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > AS/AV*

image:images/as_av.jpg[AS/AV]

. At the Anti-Virus fields, enter parameters, as appropriate for your
requirements.

. From the *Gear* icon, select *Save* to use your settings.

|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|Definition update frequency|
By default, the Zimbra MTA checks every two hours for any new anti-virus

|Send notification to recipient|
To alert that a mail message had a virus and was not delivered.


|=======================================================================

During {product-name} installation, the administrator notification
address for anti- virus alerts is configured. The default is to set up
the admin account to receive the notification. When a virus has been
found, a notification is automatically sent to that address.

[NOTE]
Updates are obtained via HTTP from the ClamAV website.

== Zimbra Free/Busy Calendar Scheduling

The Free/Busy feature allows users to view each other's calendars for
efficiently scheduling meetings. You can set up free/busy scheduling across
{product-abbrev} and Microsoft Exchange servers.

{product-abbrev} can query the free/busy schedules of users on Microsoft Exchange 2003,
2007, or 2010 servers and also can propagate the free/busy schedules of {product-abbrev}
users to the Exchange servers.

To set free/busy interoperability, the Exchange systems must be set up as
described in the Exchange Setup Requirements section, and the
{product-name} Global Config, Domain, COS and Account settings must be
configured. The easiest way to configure {product-name} is from the
Administration Console.

=== Exchange 2003/2007/2010 Setup Requirements

The following is required to set up the free/busy feature:

* Either a single Active Directory (AD) must be in the system or the global
catalog must be available.

* The {product-name} server must be able to access the HTTP(S) port
of IIS on at least one of the Exchange servers.

* Web interface to Exchange public folders needs to be available via
IIS. (http://server/public/)

* {product-name} users must be provisioned as a contact on the AD
using the same administrative group for each mail domain. This is required
only for {product-abbrev} to Exchange free/busy replication.

* For {product-name} to Exchange free/busy replication, the Exchange
user email address must be provisioned in the account attribute
*zimbra-ForeignPrincipal* for all {product-name} users.

=== Configuring Free/Busy on {product-name}

To set Free/Busy Interoperability up from the Administration Console, the
global config, Domain, COS and Account settings must be configured as
described here.

* Configure the Exchange server settings, either globally or per-domain.

** Microsoft Exchange Server URL. This is the Web interface to the
Exchange.

** Microsoft Exchange Authentication Scheme, either *Basic* or *Form*.

*** Basic is authentication to Exchange via HTTP basic authentication.

*** Form is authentication to Exchange as HTML form based authentication.

** Microsoft Exchange Server Type, either *WebDav* or *ews*

*** Select WebDAV to support free/busy with Exchange 2003 or Exchange 2007.

*** Select ews (Exchange Web Service) to support free/busy with Exchange
2010, SP1.

* Include the Microsoft Exchange user name and password. This is the name
of the account in Active Directory and password that has access to the
public folders. These are used to authenticate against the Exchange server
on REST and WebDAV interfaces.

* Add the *o* and *ou* values that are configured in the *legacyExchangeDN*
attribute for Exchange on the Global Config Free/Busy Interop page, the
Domain Free/Busy Interop page or on the Class of Service (COS) Advanced
page. Set at the global level this applies to all accounts talking to
Exchange.

* In the Account's Free/Busy Interop page, configure the foreign principal
email address for the account. This sets up a mapping from the
{product-name} account to the corresponding object in the AD.

[NOTE]
To find these settings on the Exchange server, you can run the Exchange
ADSI Edit tool and search the *legacyExchangeDN* attribute for the `o=` ,
`ou=` , and `cn=` settings.

=== {product-name} to {product-name} Free/Busy Interoperability

You can set up free/busy interoperability between {product-abbrev} servers.  Free/Busy
interoperability is configured on each server.

[NOTE]
Each server must be running {product-abbrev} 8.0.x or later.

. Enter the server host names and ports.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraFreebusyExternalZimbraURL http[s]://[user:pass@]host:port
----
+
If the *user:pass* is not included, the server runs an anonymous free/busy
lookup.

. Restart the server.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmcontrol restart
----

. Repeat these steps at all other servers.

== Setting Up S/MIME

S/MIME is a standard to send secure email messages. S/MIME messages use
digital signature to authenticate and encrypt messages.

Currently, there are two versions of S/MIME feature

. The old client based solution which requires Java 1.6 SE deployed on client machine
. The new server based solution which does not require Java on client machine. The server performs all the cryptographic operations.

=== Setting up client based S/MIME feature

==== Prerequisites

* To use S/MIME, users must have a PKI certificate and a private key.  The
private key must be installed in the user's local certificate store on
Windows and Apple Mac and in the browser certificate store if they use the
Firefox browser. See the appropriate computer or browser documentation for
how to install certificates.

* Users can use any of the following browsers:

** Mozilla Firefox 4 or later

** Internet Explorer 8, 9

** Chrome 12 or later

* Users computers must have Java 1.6 SE deployed to use S/MIME. If they do
not, they see an error asking them to install it.

==== S/MIME License

You must have a {product-abbrev} license that is enabled for S/MIME.

==== Enable S/MIME Feature

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Class of Service -> _COS_ -> Features* +
*Home > Manage > Accounts -> _account_ -> Features*

The S/MIME feature can be enabled from either the COS or Account
FeaturesTab.

. Select the COS or account to edit.
. In the Features tab S/MIME features section, check *Enable S/MIME*.
. Click *Save*.

==== Importing S/MIME Certificates

Users can send encrypted messages to recipients if they have the
recipients' public-key certificate stored in one of the following:

* Recipient's contact page in their Address Book.
* Local OS or browser keystore.
* External LDAP directory.

The certificates should be published into the LDAP directory so that they
can be retrieved from the GAL. The format of the S/MIME certificates must
be X.509 Base64 encoded DER.

===== Configure External LDAP Lookup for Certificates

If you use an external LDAP to store certificates, you can configure the
Zimbra server to lookup and retrieve certificates from the external LDAP,
on behalf of the client.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > S/MIME* +
*Home > Configure > Domains -> _domain_ -> S/MIME*

You can configure the external LDAP server settings from either the *Global
Settings > S/MIME* tab or the *Domains > S/MIME* tab.

[NOTE]
Global Settings override Domain settings

. Edit the global settings page or select a domain to edit. Open the
*S/MIME* tab.

. In the *Configuration Name* field, enter a name to identify the external
LDAP server. Example, *companyLDAP_1*
. In the *LDAP URL* field, enter the LDAP server's URL. Example,
*ldap://host.domain:3268*

=== Setting up server based S/MIME feature

==== Prerequisites

Same as the previous S/MIME version except that the Java is not required on client machine

==== S/MIME License

Same as the previous S/MIME version

==== Enable S/MIME Feature

Same as the previous S/MIME version

==== Importing S/MIME Certificates

Same as the previous S/MIME version except that the recipients' public-key certificate no longer need to be stored into Local OS or browser keystore.
The certificate can be published to all other places mentioned in previous S/MIME version.

==== List of LDAP attributes introduced in new S\MIME feature

. zimbraSmimeOCSPEnabled

* Used by server at the time of validating the user as well as public certificates
* If TRUE, the revocation check will be performed during certificate validation
* If FALSE, the revocation check will not be performed during certificate validation

. zimbraSmimePublicCertificateExtensions

* The supported public certificate file extensions separated by comma
* Contains the list of supported formats for userCertificate LDAP attribute
* Default values: cer,crt,der,spc,p7b,p7r,sst,sto,pem
* Zimbra web client retrieves from server the supported file formats/extensions for public certificate upload

. zimbraSmimeUserCertificateExtensions

* The supported public certificate file extensions separated by comma.
* Contains the list of supported formats for userSmimeCertificate LDAP attribute
* Default values: p12,pfx
* Zimbra web client retrieves from server the supported file formats/extensions for user certificate upload

==== Process for Adding the CA certificate to the mailbox truststore for S/MIME

S/MIME uses the mailbox trust store path and its password defined in localconfig.xml

The key names are:

* mailboxd_truststore
* mailboxd_truststore_password

If the key is not defined in localconfig.xml, by default the values of mailboxd_truststore and mailboxd_truststore_password are:

* <zimbra_java_home>/jre/lib/security/cacerts
* changeit

CA certificate can be imported to mailbox trust store by executing following command:

keytool -import -alias <alias> -keystore <mailboxd_truststore path> -trustcacerts -file <CA_Cert>

== Admin SIEVE Filter

* The admin SIEVE feature enables the system administrator to define one SIEVE rule executed before and one SIEVE rule executed after the end user-defined filter rule.
* The system-admin-defined SIEVE rule will be combined with the end-user-defined SEIVE rule, and then combined one big SIEVE rule will be applied to both incoming and outgoing messages. But, the scope of the variables is local within each script (zimbraMailAdminSieveScriptBefore, zimbraMailSieveScript, zimbraMailAdminSieveScriptAfter) OR (zimbraMailAdminOutgoingSieveScriptBefore, zimbraMailOutgoingSieveScript, zimbraMailAdminOutgoingSieveScriptAfter)
* The system-admin-defined SIEVE rule will be hidden from the end user.  From the ZWC UI, the end user can only see and edit his/her own SIEVE rule.  Only the system administrator can view and edit the system-admin-defined SIEVE rule.

=== List of SIEVE LDAP attributes

. zimbraMailAdminSieveScriptBefore

* For any incoming message, the system operator can apply a specific SIEVE filter rule to every mailbox before the user-defined filter rule is performed.
* The contents of the rule itself may vary from person to person or system-wide/server-wide/domain-wide/CoS-wide though.
* Usually the SPAM evaluation headers, such as "X-Spam", "X-Spam-Number", "X-Spam-Score", "X-Spam-Level", are defined system-widely. It makes more sense to check the system-specific headers by admin instead of end user.

. zimbraMailAdminSieveScriptAfter

* For any incoming message, the system operator can apply a specific SIEVE filter rule to every mailbox after the user-defined filter rule is performed.

. zimbraMailAdminOutgoingSieveScriptBefore

* For any outgoing message, the system operator can apply a specific SIEVE filter rule to every mailbox before the user-defined filter rule is performed.

. zimbraMailAdminOutgoingSieveScriptAfter

* For any outgoing message, the system operator can apply a specific SIEVE filter rule to every mailbox after the user-defined filter rule is performed.

. zimbraSieveFeatureVariablesEnabled

* TRUE - Enable SIEVE variable feature in user sieve script
* FALSE - Disable SIEVE variable feature in user sieve script

. zimbraAdminSieveFeatureVariablesEnabled

* TRUE - Enable SIEVE variable feature in admin sieve script
* FALSE - Disable SIEVE variable feature in admin sieve script

== Storage Management

=== Managing Storage Volumes

In the Volume page you manage storage volumes on the Zimbra Mailbox
server. When {product-name} is installed, one index volume and one
message volume are configured on each mailbox server. You can add new
volumes, set the volume type, and set the compression threshold.

[NOTE]
If Compress Blobs is enabled (YES), the disk space used is decreased, but
memory requirements for the server increases.

==== Index Volumes

Each Zimbra mailbox server is configured with one current index volume.
Each mailbox is assigned to a permanent directory on the current index
volume. You cannot change which volume the account is assigned.

As volumes become full, you can create a new current index volume for new
accounts. You can add new volumes, set the volume type, and set the
compression threshold.

Index volumes not marked current are still actively in use for the accounts
assigned to them. Any index volume that is referenced by a mailbox as its
index volume cannot be deleted.

==== Message Volumes

When a new message is delivered or created, the message is saved in the
current message volume. Message volumes can be created, but only one is
configured as the current volume where new messages are stored. When the
volume is full, you can configure a new current message volume. The current
message volume receives all new messages. New messages are never stored in
the previous volume.

A current volume cannot be deleted, and message volumes that have messages
referencing the volume cannot be deleted.

=== Implementing Hierarchical Storage Management

Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) allows you to configure storage
volumes for older messages. HSM is a process of moving older data from the
primary volume to the current secondary volume based on the age of the
data.

To manage your disk utilization, implement a global HSM policy or a HSM
policy for each mailbox server. The policy configured on individual servers
overrides the policy configured as the global policy.

Email messages and the other items in the account are moved from the
primary volume to the current secondary volume based on the HSM policy.
Users are not aware of any change and do not see any noticeable differences
when opening older items that have been moved.

The default global HSM policy moves messages and document files more than
30 days old to the secondary volume. You can also select to move tasks,
appointments, and contacts. The schedule for moving can be set for items
older than a specified number of days, months, weeks, hours, minutes.

In addition to selecting different items to move, you can use the search
query language to set up other HSM policies.

For example: to include all messages marked as spam in messages moved to
the current secondary volume, you would add the following to the policy:
*message:in:junk before:-[x] days*.

[NOTE]
The search string can be added to the default policy or you can write a new
policy.

==== Scheduling HSM Sessions

Sessions to move messages to the secondary volume are scheduled in your
cron table. From the Administration Console, when you select a server, you
can manually start a HSM session, monitor HSM sessions, and abort HSM
sessions that are in progress from the Volumes page.

You can manually start an HSM session from the server's *Gear* icon.

When you abort a session and then restart the process, the HSM session
looks for entries in the primary store that meet the HSM age criteria.  Any
entries that were moved in the previous run would be excluded, as they
would no longer exist in the primary store.

HSM jobs can be configured to be a specific batch size. The
`zimbraHsmBatchSize` attribute can be configured either as a global setting
or per server to specify the maximum number of items to move during a
single HSM operation. The default value is 10000. If the limit is exceeded
the HSM operation is repeated until all qualifying items are moved.

Global batch size modification:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraHsmBatchSize <num>
----

Modifying batch size on a server:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov ms `zmhostname` zimbraHsmBatchSize <num>
----

== Email Retention Management

You can configure retention policies for user account's email, trash, and
junk folders. The basic email retention policy is to set the email, trash
and spam message lifetime in the COS or for individual accounts.

You can set up specific retention policies that users can enable for the
Inbox and other email folders in their account. Users can also create their
own retention policies.

You can enable the dumpster feature to save messages that are deleted from
Trash. When an message lifetime has been reached based on email lifetime
rules or deletion policies, the message is moved to the dumpster if it is
enabled. Users can recover deleted items from the dumpster until the
threshold set in the *Visibility lifetime in dumpster for end user*
setting.

If dumpster is not enabled, messages are purged from the server when the
email retention lifetime is reached.

You can also set up a legal hold on an account to prevent message from
being deleted.

=== Configuring Email Lifetime Rules

You can configure when email messages should be deleted from an accounts
folders, and the trash and junk folders by COS or for individual accounts.

.Email Lifetime Options
[cols="1,2",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Email Lifetime Option |Description

|Email message lifetime |
Number of days a message can remain in a folder before it is purged. This
includes data in RSS folders. +
Default = 0 +
Minimum = 30 days

|Trashed message lifetime |
Number of days a message remains in the Trash folder before it is purged. +
Default = 30 days.

|Spam message lifetime|
Number of days a message can remain in the Junk folder before it is purged. +
Default = 30 days.

|=======================================================================

=== Purging Email Messages

By default, the server purges email messages that have exceeded their
lifetime every minute. You can change the duration of time that the server
should "rest" between purging mailboxes.

Use the global Sleep Time setting to define duration, in minutes, between
mailbox purges.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > General Information*

image:images/GeneralInformation.jpg[Purge Interval]

For example, the purge interval is set to 1 minute, after mailbox1 is
purged of messages that meet the message lifetime setting, the server waits
1 minute before beginning to purge mailbox2.

If the message purge schedule is set to 0, messages are not purged even if
the mail, trash and spam message lifetime is set.

[NOTE]
Because users cannot view message lifetime settings, you will
need to apprise them of your purge policies.

=== Configuring Message Retention and Deletion Policies

Retention and deletion policies can be configured as a global setting or
as a COS setting. Users can select these policies to apply to their
message folders in their account. They can also set up their own
retention and deletion policies. Users enable a policy you set up or
create their own policies from their folders' Edit Properties dialog
box.

=== Global Retention Policy

System wide retention and deletion policies can be managed from the
Administration Console.

Use the global Retention Policy page to set global retention or deletion
policies.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Global Settings > Retention Policy*

image:images/GlobalRetentionPolicy.jpg[Global Retention Policy]

=== COS Retention Policy

Use the COS Retention Policy page to set retention or deletion for the
selected COS.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Class of Service -> _COS_ -> Retention Policy*

image:images/COSRetentionPolicy.jpg[COS Retention Policy]

Ensure that the *Enable COS-level policies instead of inheriting from the
policy defined in Global Settings* is enabled.

The retention policy is not automatically enforced on a folder. If users
option an item in a folder that has not met the threshold of the retention
policy, the following message is displayed, *You are deleting a message
that is within its folder's retention period. Do you wish to delete the
message?*

When the threshold for the deletion policy is reached, items are deleted
from the account. They are not sent to the Trash folder. If the dumpster
feature is enabled, they are sent to the dumpster, if it is not enabled,
they are purged from the server.

==== How Lifetime and Retention/Deletion Policies Work Together

If the Email Message Lifetime is set to a value other than zero (0), this
setting applies in addition to the disposal or retention policy values
applied to a folder. For example:

Email Message Lifetime is set to 120 days

* Folder A has a policy with a disposal threshold of 360 days. Messages in
Folder a are disposed of in 120 days.

* Folder B has a policy with disposal threshold of 90 days. Messages in
Folder B are disposed of in 90 days.

* Folder C has a policy with retention range of 150 days. Messages in
Folder C are disposed of in 120 days.

=== Managing the Dumpster

When a message, trash or spam lifetime has been reached, the message is
moved to the dumpster if the feature is enabled. When users right-click on
Trash, they can click *Recover deleted items* to retrieve items from their
trash that has been deleted in the last x days. This threshold is based on
the *Visibility lifetime in dumpster for end user* setting.

The *Retention lifetime in dumpster before purging setting* sets retention
lifetime for items in dumpster. Items in dumpster older than the threshold
are purged and cannot be retrieved.

Administrators can access the individual dumpster's content, including
spam, and they can delete data at any time before the message lifetime is
reached.

==== Searching for an item in the dumpster folder

[source,bash]
----
zmmailbox -z -m <user@example.com> search --dumpster -l <#> --types <message,contact,document> <search-field>
----

The search field can be a date range: 'before:mm/dd/yyyy and
after:mm/dd/yyyy' or emails from or to a particular person:
'from:Joe', etc.

==== Deleting items in the dumpster folder

Items in the dumpster folder can be deleted with the CLI or from the
Administration Console:

[source,bash]
----
zmmailbox -z -m <user@example.com> -A dumpsterDeleteItem <item-ids>
----

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Class of Service -> _COS_ -> Features -> General Features*

. Enable (check) the *Dumpster folder* checkbox.
. To set *Visibility lifetime in dumpster for end user*, go to the COS's,
*Advanced* page, *Timeout Policy* section.
. To set *Retention lifetime in dumpster before purging*, go to the COS's
*Advanced* page, *Email Retention Policy* section.

=== Configure Legal Hold on an Account

If the dumpster folder feature is enabled, you can set up a legal hold to
preserve all items in user accounts.

When dumpster is enabled, *Can purge dumpster folder* is also enabled.
Disabling this feature turns off purging of items in the user's
dumpster. This can be set on a COS or for individual accounts. When *Can
purge dumpster folder* is enabled, any deletion policies set up on the
accounts' folders are ignored.

Configure legal hold:

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Class of Service -> _COS_ -> Features* +
*Home > Manage > Accounts -> _account_ -> Features*

Deselect *Can purge dumpster folder* on the *Features* page.

== Customized Admin Extensions

Developers can create and add custom modules to the Zimbra Administration
Console user interface, to provide new views, manage new data objects,
extend existing objects with new properties, and customize existing views.
