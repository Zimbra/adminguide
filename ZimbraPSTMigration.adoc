== Zimbra PST Migration Wizard
The Zimbra PST Migration Wizard helps migrate Microsoft Outlook personal folders (`PST`) files to Zimbra Collaboration.

The tool runs in two modes:

* Migration wizard with a graphical interface
* Migration utility which uses a command line interface 

== Migration Wizard GUI
Zimbra PST Migration Wizard is an application that helps users migrate their `PST` files to Zimbra Collaboration Server using a very intuitive interface.

The tool has 4 phases:

Source:: Locate and select the `PST` file to migrate to Zimbra Collaboration Server.
Destination:: Enter login credentials associated with Zimbra Collaboration Server.
Options:: Specify folders, items, and other available options for migration.
Results:: View migration status, including progress, errors, and warnings.

[#source-info]
=== Source Information
. Click *Source*.
. Click `...` beside *PST File* field to open a file browser window.
. Navigate to and choose the `PST` file to migrate to Zimbra Collaboration Server.
. Choose a log detail level. Logs are written to folder `%temp%/ZimbraMigration` and are useful for diagnosing migration issues. Support may request logs when you require assistance. We recommend that you set the log level to *Verbose* while becoming familiar with the tool.
+
IMPORTANT: Logs are automatically deleted after seven days to conserve disk space, so take backup copies if you require assistance after seven days of performing a migration. During migration, you can open a log file by clicking *Open Log File* on the *Results* page.
+
. Click *Next*.

[#destination-info]
=== Destination Information
An administrator creates the account for you on the Zimbra Collaboration Server and gives you the migration tool application and the following information which you need to migrate your `PST` files.

. In the *Destination* dialog, box, enter below details.
 Hostname:: This is the domain name of the Zimbra server.
 Port:: The port number used by the server is usually `80` for non-secure connections and `443` for secure connections.
 Use Secure Connection:: Select the option for SSL secure communication with {product-short}.
 Username::  Enter your {product-name} account email address as *\name@domain.com*.
 Password:: Enter your {product-name} account password.
 . Click *Next*.

[#select-options]
=== Selecting Options to Migrate
. Under *Item Types*, choose items to import.
. Choose *Additional Folders* to migrate *Sent*, *Deleted Items* (Trash), and *Junk* (Spam) folders.
. *Filters*: Choose below filter options to skip unwanted `PST` items during migration.
 * *Migrate On or After*: This option filters out messages from before the provided date. The tool skips the migration of messages before this date.
 * *Maximum message size*: The message size includes the message and attachments. Leave the field blank to use the Zimbra Collaboration server setting for maximum message size.
** If you set a value here, this value cannot be larger than the global MTA setting for the maximum size of a message. The default maximum message size is 0 (indicating no size limit).
+
NOTE: Setting *0* as maximum size does not override the limits specified in the Zimbra Collaboration server.

  *Skip these folders, and their children (separate with a comma)*:: Enter names of folders, and all its subfolders, separated by a comma, to skip their migration.
  *Skip previously migrated items*:: Select this box to skip migration of Previously migrated items.
+
NOTE: You can view and change the Maximum size of a message value from the Administration Console *Configure* -> *Global Settings* -> *MTA* tab.
+
. Click *Save* to save configuration information in a file which can be loaded later using the Load button on the <<#source-info>> page when you next run the migration tool.
. Click *Back* to go back and change specifics in <<#source-info>> or <<#destination-info>>.
. Click *Migrate* to begin the migration process.

=== Viewing Migration Results
In the Results dialog, view the migration status of the `PST` file, including progress, errors, and warnings.

To view the results log, double click your account. A new tab opens and displays the account log information.

 Account:: This shows the migration status. The progress bar shows the state of the migration, accompanied by status messages. *Min/Avg/Max* are the minimum, average and maximum times (in milliseconds) to migrate items in that account. Read/Write indicate proportionally how much time is spent reading data from the source vs. writing data to the Zimbra Collaboration server. These figures are useful for detecting network/server bottlenecks. For example, 90%:10% would indicate the source is the bottleneck.
 ** Double-click your account name in Accounts, and an individual tab shows folder-by-folder migration status, along with folder-by-folder bottleneck statistics mentioned above. Click *X* on the appropriate tab to close view.
 Open Log File:: Opens the log file associated with your `PST` file's migration. The Log files are at `%temp%\ZimbraMigration\Logs\*.log`. Each migration generates several log files. `*migrate.log` contains overall migration session data. `*migrate-SUMMARY.log` contains a summary of key events from the migration session. In addition there will be one log for each account migrated -- `*migrate [src-account-name]` to `[dest-account-name].log`.
 Stop:: Click Stop to stop the migration. To restart, go back to the previous view, and click the Migrate button.
 Exit:: Click Exit to close the migration tool.

== Migration Wizard CLI
Zimbra PST Migration Wizard also has a command line interface to help users migrate their `PST` files to Zimbra Collaboration Server using one command with multiple, intuitively named, arguments.

The command requires a configuration file (`XML`) and a `PST` file.
[#create-config-file]
=== Creating Configurations file
. Launch {product-name}.
. Specify <<#source-info, Source Information>>.
. Specify <<#destination-info, Destination Information>>.
. <<#select-options, Select options>> applicable to current migration.
+
NOTE: Options chosen here can be overridden by specifying the arguments available in the command line utility.
+
. Once done, click *Save* to save the above configurations as an `XML` file.

=== Running the Utility
Format::
`ZimbraMigrationConsole ConfigxmlFile=<path to XML file> [arg1] [arg2] ...`

Example::
`ZimbraMigrationConsole ConfigxmlFile=../Config.xml Calendar=true Contacts=true`

Explanation::
The tool migrates Calendar and Contacts from the PST mentioned in the `XML` file

NOTE: The tool accepts multiple other arguments which are precisely like when <<#select-options, selecting options>> to migrate. Run the utility with `-Help` as a switch to see all supported arguments.
