= Zimbra Proxy Server
:toc:

Zimbra Proxy is a high-performance proxy server that can be configured as a
POP3/IMAP/HTTP proxy used to reverse proxy IMAP/POP3 and HTTP client
requests to a set of backend servers.

The Zimbra Proxy package is installed and configured during the
{product-name} installation. You can install this package on a mailbox
server, MTA server, or on its own independent server. When the Zimbra Proxy
package is installed, the proxy feature is enabled. In most cases, no
modification is necessary.

== Benefits of Using Zimbra Proxy

Benefits for using Zimbra Proxy include:

* Zimbra proxy centralizes access to Mailbox servers
* Load Balancing
* Security
* Authentication
* SSL Termination
* Caching
* Centralized Logging and Auditing
* URL Rewriting
* Strict Server Name Enforcement (optional)

== Zimbra Proxy Components

Zimbra Proxy is designed to provide a HTTP/POP/IMAP proxy that is quick,
reliable, and scalable. Zimbra Proxy includes the following:

[cols="1,2",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Component |Description

|Nginx |
High performance HTTP/IMAP/POP3 proxy server that handles all incoming
HTTP/POP/IMAP requests.

|Memcached |
High performance distributed memory object caching system in which routing
information is cached to enable increased performance.

|Zimbra Proxy Route Lookup Handler |
Servelet—located on the {product-short} mailbox server—that handles queries for the
user account route information. This routing information consists of the
server and port number where the user account resides.

|=======================================================================

== Proxy Architecture and Flow

This section describes the architecture and flow sequence of Zimbra proxy.

. End clients connect to Zimbra Proxy using HTTP/HTTPS/POP/IMAP ports.

. When {product-name} Proxy receives an incoming connection, the
Nginx component sends an HTTP request to {product-name} Proxy Route
Lookup Handler component.
+
image:proxy_architecture_and_flow.png[Proxy Architecture]

.  {product-name} Proxy Route Lookup Handler locates the route
information for the account being accessed and returns this to Nginx.

.  The Memcached component stores the route information for the configured
period of time (the default is one hour). Nginx uses this route information
instead of querying the {product-name} Proxy Route Lookup Handler
until the default period of time has expired.

.  Nginx uses the route information to connect to {product-name}
Mailbox.

.  {product-name} Proxy connects to {product-name} Mailbox and
initiates the web/mail proxy session. The end client behaves as if it is
connecting directly to {product-name} Mailbox.

== Changing the Zimbra Proxy Configuration

When Zimbra proxy is configured, the Zimbra proxy config performs keyword
substitution as necessary with values from the LDAP configuration and
localconfig.

If changes are required after the Zimbra Proxy is set up, modify the Zimbra
LDAP attributes or localconfig values and run zmconfigd to generate the
updated Zimbra Proxy configuration. The Zimbra proxy configuration file is
in `/opt/zimbra/conf/nginx.conf`. The nginx.conf includes the main config,
memcache config, mail config, and web config files.

Common changes to Zimbra Proxy configuration are IMAP/POP configuration
changes from the original default setup

* HTTP reverse proxy configuration changes from the original default setup

* GSSAPI authentication for Kerberos. In this case you manually identify
the location of the Kerberos Keytab file, including Zimbra Proxy password

== Zimbra Proxy

Zimbra Proxy allows end users to access their {product-name} account
using clients such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or other
POP/IMAP end-client software. End users can connect using POP3, IMAP, POP3S
(Secure POP3), or IMAPS (Secure IMAP).

For example, proxying allows users to enter imap.example.com as their IMAP
server. The proxy running on imap.example.com inspects their IMAP traffic,
does a lookup to determine which backend mailbox server a user’s mailbox
lives on and transparently proxies the connection from user’s IMAP client
to the correct mailbox server.

=== Zimbra Proxy Ports

The following ports are used either by Zimbra Proxy or by Zimbra Mailbox
(if Proxy is not configured). If you have any other services running on
these ports, turn them off.

End clients connect directly to Zimbra Proxy, using the Zimbra Proxy
Ports. Zimbra Proxy connects to the Route Lookup Handler or Zimbra Mailbox
using the Zimbra Mailbox Ports.

.Proxy Ports
[cols=","]
|====================================================
|*Zimbra Proxy Ports (External to {product-short})* |*Port*

|HTTP |80

|HTTPS |443

|POP3 |110

|POP3S (Secure POP3) |995

|IMAP |143

|IMAPS (Secure IMAP) |993

|*Zimbra Mailbox Ports (Internal to {product-short})* |*Port*

|Route Lookup Handler |7072

|HTTP Backend (if Proxy configured) |8080

|HTTPS Backend (if Proxy configured) |8443

|POP3 Backend (if Proxy configured) |7110

|POP3S Backend (if Proxy configured) |7995

|IMAP Backend (if Proxy configured) |7143

|IMAPS Backend (if Proxy configured) |7993

|====================================================

=== Strict Server Name Enforcement

Zimbra Proxy has the ability to strictly enforce which values are allowed in the `Host` header
passed in by the client.

This is _enabled by default_ on *new installations* but left _disabled_ for *upgrades* from previous
versions unless toggled during the installation.

The functionality may be altered by setting the `zimbraReverseProxyStrictServerNameEnabled` boolean configuration
option followed by restarting the proxy server.

* TRUE - strict server name enforcement enabled
* FALSE - strict server name enforcement disabled

[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraReverseProxyStrictServerNameEnabled TRUE
----

When the strict server name functionality is enabled, additional valid server names may be specified
using the `zimbraVirtualHostName` and `zimbraVirtualIPAddress` configuration items at the domain level.

[source,bash]
----
zmprov md example.com zimbraVirtualHostName mail.example.com zimbraVirtualIPAddress 1.2.3.4
----

[NOTE]
Only one virtual ip address is needed per domain although more than one is acceptable.

=== Setting Up IMAP and POP Proxy After HTTP Proxy Installation

IMAP proxy is installed with {product-name} and set up during
installation from the configuration menus. To set up the HTTP proxy, the
proxy must be installed on the identified proxy nodes in order to set up
HTTP proxy. No other configuration is usually required.

If you need to, set up IMAP/POP proxy after you have already installed HTTP proxy, and set up the mailbox server and the proxy node.

[NOTE]
You can run the command as `zmproxyconfig -r`, to run against a remote
host. This requires the server to be properly configured in the LDAP
master.

==== Set Up IMAP/POP Proxy with Separate Proxy Node

Use steps in this section if your configuration includes a
separate proxy server.

. On each Zimbra mailbox server that you want to proxy with, enable the
proxy for IMAP/POP proxy.

== Configuring Zimbra HTTP Proxy

Zimbra Proxy can also reverse proxy HTTP requests to the right back-end
server.

For example, users can use a web browser to connect to the proxy server at `\https://mail.example.com`. The connection from users whose mailboxes live on mbs1.example.com is proxied to mbs1.example.com by the proxy running on the mail.example.com server. The proxy also supports REST and CalDAV clients, Zimbra Connector for Outlook, and Zimbra Mobile Sync NG devices.

HTTP reverse proxy routes requests as follows:

* If the requesting URL can be examined to determine the user name, then
the request is routed to the backend mailbox server of the user in the
URL. REST, CalDAV, and Zimbra Mobile Sync are supported through this
mechanism.

* If the request has an auth token cookie (*ZM_AUTH_TOKEN*), the request is
routed to the backend mailbox server of the authenticated user.

* If the above methods do not work, the IP hash method is used to load
balance the requests across the backend mailbox servers which are able to
handle the request or do any necessary internal proxying.

=== Setting Up HTTP Proxy

To set up HTTP proxy, Zimbra Proxy must be installed on the identified
nodes.

[NOTE]

You can run the command as `/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmproxyconfig -r`, to run
against a remote host. Note that this requires the server to be properly
configured in the LDAP master.

==== Setting Up HTTP Proxy as a Separate Proxy Node

*Set Up Proxy to use Clear Text for Upstream Connections*

When setting up the proxy to use clear text for upstream connections, set
`zimbraReverseProxySSLToUpstreamEnabled` to FALSE.

This attribute defaults to TRUE. In an "out of the box" proxy set up,
the upstream communication defaults to SSL.

*REST URL Generation*

For REST URL, you set the host name, service protocol, and services port
globally or for a specific domain from the following attributes.

* `zimbraPublicServiceHostname`
* `zimbraPublicServiceProtocol`
* `zimbraPublicServicePort`

When generating REST URL’s:

* If `domain.zimbraPublicServiceHostname` is set, use
`zimbraPublicServiceProtocol` + `zimbraPublicServiceHostname` + `zimbraPublicServicePort`

* Otherwise it falls back to the server (account's home server) attributes:
** protocol is computed from `server.zimbraMailMode`
** hostname is `server.zimbraServiceHostname`

* port is computed from the protocol.

[NOTE]
About using `zimbraMailReferMode` - In earlier versions, a local config
variable — `zimbra_auth_always_send_refer` — determined which action the
back-end server took when a user’s mailbox did not reside on the server
that the user logged in to. The default value of FALSE redirected the user
if the user was logging in on the incorrect backend host.

On a multiserver {product-short}, if a load balanced name was needed to create a
friendly landing page, a user would always have to be redirected. In that
case, `zimbra_auth_always_send_refer` was set to TRUE.

Now with a full-fledged reverse proxy, users do not need to be
redirected. The localconfig variable `zimbraMailReferMode` is used with
nginx reverse proxy.

=== Setting Proxy Trusted IP Addresses

When a proxy is configured with {product-short}, each proxy server’s IP
address must be configured in LDAP attribute `zimbraMailTrustedIP` to
identify the proxy addresses as trusted when users log in through the
proxy. The proxy IP address is added to the `X-Forwarded-For` header
information. The `X-Forwarded-For` header is automatically added to the
localconfig `zimbra_http_originating_ip` header attribute. When a user logs
in, this IP address and the user’s address are verified in the Zimbra
mailbox log.

Set each proxy IP address in the attribute. For example, if you have two
proxy servers:

[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf +zimbraMailTrustedIP {IP of nginx-1} +zimbraMailTrustedIP {IP of nginx-2}
----

[TIP]
--
To verify that X-Forwarded-For was correctly added to the localconfig, type
[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig | grep -i http
----

You should see

[source,bash]
----
zimbra_http originating_ip_header = X-Forwarded-For
----

== Configuring Zimbra Proxy for Kerberos Authentication

Use steps in this section if you use the Kerberos5 authenticating
mechanism, and want to configure it for the IMAP and POP proxy.

[NOTE]
Make sure that your Kerberos5 authentication mechanism is correctly
configured. See <<zimbra_ldap_service,Zimbra LDAP Service>>

. On each proxy node, set the zimbraReverseProxyDefaultRealm server
attribute to the realm name corresponding to the proxy server. For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov ms [DNS name.isp.net] zimbraReverseProxyDefaultRealm [ISP.NET]
----

. Each proxy IP address where email clients connect must be configured for
GSSAPI authentication by the mail server. On each proxy node for each of
the proxy IP addresses:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf +zimbraReverseProxyAdminIPAddress [IP address]
----

. On each proxy server:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov ms [proxyexample.net] zimbraReverseProxyImapSaslGssapiEnabled TRUE

zmprov ms proxyl.isp.net zimbraReverseProxyPop3SaslGssapiEnabled TRUE
----

. Restart the proxy server
+
[source,bash]
----
zmproxyctl restart
----
