===================================================================================================================================================

This repository contains the code necessary to build the Zimbra
Administration Guide.

This guide is intended for system administrators responsible for
installing, maintaining, and supporting the server deployment of
Zimbra.

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

The Zimbra Administration Guide is written using
link:http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. Specifically, it is intended to be
processed with link:http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].

As a prerequisite to building the documentation, you will need to have
already installed and configured
link:http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. Check the
link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#installation-quick-start[Installation
Quick Start] in the
link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoctor User Manual] for
information on how to get started.

Once you have Asciidoctor installed and working, you can build the
documentation into HTML files like so:

[source,bash]
----
asciidoctor -b html5 -D ~/repos/adminguide-ghpages/8.8.9 -o admin_guide.html index.adoc
----

Each section of the document is contained in its own file. You may use the
`index.adoc` file to generate the entire document.

The `images/` directory must also be copied to the output destination:

[source,bash]
-----
cp -r ./images ~/repos/adminguide-ghpages/8.8.9/images
-----
