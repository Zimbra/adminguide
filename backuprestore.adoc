= Backup and Restore
:toc:

{product-name} includes a configurable backup manager that resides on every
{product-name} server and performs both backup and restore functions. You
do not have to stop the {product-name} server in order to run the backup
process.

This chapter describes how data is backed up and restored and how to use
the CLI tools to backup or restore your {product-name} mailbox
server. In addition, this chapter also provides information and general
guidelines for disaster recovery.

== Backing Up the Mailbox Server

{product-name} includes a configurable backup manager that resides
on every {product-name} server and performs both backup and
restore functions. You do not have to stop the {product-name}
server in order to run the backup process. The backup manager can be
used to restore a single user, rather than having to restore the entire
system in the event that one user’s mailbox becomes corrupted. Full and
incremental backups are saved in in `opt/zimbra/backup`.


=== Redo Log

Each Zimbra mailbox server generates redo logs that contain current and
archived transactions processed by the message store server since the
last incremental backup.

When the server is restored, after the backed up files are fully
restored, any redo logs in the archive and the current redo log in use
are replayed to bring the system to the point before the failure.

When the current redo log file size reaches 100MB, the current redo log
rolls over to an archive directory. At that point, the server starts a
new redo log. All uncommitted transactions from the previous redo log
are preserved. In the case of a crash, when the server restarts, the
current redo logs are read to re-apply any uncommitted transactions.

When an incremental backup is run, the redo logs are moved from the
archive to the backup directory.

== Backup Methods

Two backup methods are available:

* The *standard backup method* is appropriate for enterprise deployments
where full backups are run during non-working days.

* The *auto-grouped backup method* is recommended for large {product-name}
environments where running a full backup of all accounts at one time would
take too long.

=== Standard Backup

The standard backup method runs a weekly full backup and daily
incremental backups. A full backup process backs up all the information
needed to restore mailboxes, including the LDAP directory server,
database, index directory, and message directory for each mailbox.

When backing up shared messages, if a file representing a message
already exists in the backup, it flags this object as such and does not
copy its content again.

An incremental backup process backs up the LDAP data and gathers all the
redo logs written since the last incremental backup. If the incremental
backup process finds no previous full backup for a mailbox, a full
backup is performed on that mailbox.

Incremental backups move the redo logs to the backup directory. The redo
logs are a journal of every activity that has taken place. They contain
a full copy of all messages delivered, as well as metadata such as tags,
contacts, and conversations.

These backup files can be used to restore the complete mailbox server or
individual mailboxes so that account and message data is completely
restored.

The LDAP directory is backed up as part of either the full or
incremental backup process. All accounts, domains, servers, COS, and
other data are backed up.

Each mailbox server generates redo logs that contain every transaction
processed by that server. If an unexpected shutdown occurs to the
server, the redo logs are used for the following:

* To ensure that no uncommitted transactions remain, the server reads
the current redo log upon startup and re-executes and completes any
uncommitted transactions.
* To recover data written since the last full backup in the event of a
server failure.

When the server is restored, after the backed up files are fully
restored, any redo logs in the archive and the current redo log in use
are replayed to bring the system to the point before the failure.

The Zimbra MTA is not backed up, as the data is only on the server for a
very short time.

Custom configurations—such as mailboxd’s server.xml—are not backed up.

==== Backup Notifcation

A backup report is sent to the admin mailbox when full and incremental
backups are performed. This report shows the success or failure of the
backup and includes information about when the backup started and ended,
the number of accounts backed up and redo log sequence range.

If the backup failed, additional error information is included.

=== Auto-Grouped Backup Method

The auto-grouped backup method runs a full backup for a different group
of mailboxes at each scheduled backup. The auto-grouped backup method is
designed for very large {product-name} environments where backing
up all accounts can take a long time. Because auto-grouped backups
combine full and incremental backup functions, there is no need for
incremental backups. Each auto-grouped session runs a full backup of the
targeted group of mailboxes. It is not recommended to run auto-grouped
backups manually since they are scheduled from the CLI and run
automatically at the scheduled times.

== Directory Structure for Backup Files

The backup destination is known as a backup target. To the backup
system, it is a path in the file system of the mail server. The Zimbra
default backup directory is +/opt/zimbra/backup+.

The backup directory structure created by the standard backup process is
shown in <<standard_backup_directory_structure, Standard Backup directory structure>>.
You can run regularly scheduled backups to the same target area without
overwriting previous backup sessions.

The *accounts.xml* file lists all accounts that are in all the backups
combined. For each account, this file shows the account ID, the email
address, and the label of the latest full backup for that account. If
you save your backup sessions to another location, you must also save
the latest accounts.xml file to that location. The accounts.xml file is
used to look up the latest full Backup for an account during restore. If
the accounts.xml file is missing you must specify the backup label to
restore from.

The redo log directory is located at +/opt/zimbra/redolog/redo.log+. When
the current redo log file size reaches 100MB, the current redo log rolls
over to an archive directory, +/opt/zimbra/redolog/archive+. At this
point the server starts a new redo log. All uncommitted transactions
from the previous redo log are preserved. In the case of a crash, when
the server restarts, the current redo logs are read to re-apply any
uncommitted transactions.

Redo operations are time critical, therefore a directory move is
performed instead of a copy-then-delete function. This directory move
can only be performed if the source and destination paths are on the
same file system volume. In other words, the redo log and redo -archive
log must be on the same file system volume because the archive files are
a subdirectory of the redo log file system.

All incremental and auto-grouped backup sessions must be saved to the
same directory as all the redo logs must be found in the same backup
target. Standard full backup sessions can use a different target
directory.

.Standard Backup directory structure
[cols=",",options=""]
|=======================================================================
|+/opt/zimbra/backup+ |
Default root of backups

|+accounts.xml/+ |
List of all accounts, each with email file address, Zimbra ID, and latest
full backup label. The accounts.xml maintains the mapping of email
addresses to their current zimbraIds and also the most recent full backup
for each account.

|+sessions/+ |
Root of backup sessions.

|+full-<timestamp>/+ |
A full backup directory. The timestamp for a session is the backup start
time in GMT, including milliseconds. GMT is used rather than local time to
preserve visual ordering across daylight savings transitions.

|+session.xml+ |
Metadata about this backup label for full or incremental session, such as
start and stop times.

|+shared_blobs/+ |
Contains message files that are shared among accounts in this backup.

|+sys/+ |
Global database tables and localconfig.

|+db_schema.xml+ |
Database schema information for global tables. Each table dump file has a
.csv format.

|+localconfig.xml+ |
Copy of +/opt/zimbra/conf/localconfig.xml+ at the time of the backup.

|+<table name>.dat+ |
Database table data dump.

|+sys/db_schema.xml+ |

|+accounts/..../<zimbraID>/ldap.xml+ |
+incr-<timestamp>+ does not include
+accounts/.../<zimbraId>/db/db_schema.xml+ because incremental backup does
not dump account tables.

|=======================================================================

[NOTE]
For auto-grouped backups, the directory structure saves the
redo log files to the full backup session. There are no incremental
backup sessions.

== Backup and Restore Using the Administration Console

Many of the backup and restore procedures can be run directly from the
Administration Console. In the Navigation pane, *Monitoring>Backup*
lists each of the servers.

=== Configure Backup from the Admin Console

Backups can be configured from the Administration Console as a global
settings configuration and as a server-specific configuration. Server
settings override global settings.

In the global settings, you can configure the email addresses to receive
notification about the results of the backup. The default is to send the
notification to the admin account.

For Auto-grouped, you configure the number of groups to divide the
backups into.

The standard backup is the default and is automatically scheduled. You do
not need to make any additional changes. But when running the auto-grouped
backup you must manually configure the backup schedule. To do so, access
the CLI and follow the steps under <<scheule_auto_group_backups, Schedule
Auto-Group Backups>> to run +zmschedulebackup -D+ to set the default
schedule for auto-grouped backups.

*Throttling option with auto-grouped backup.* The auto-grouped backup
methodautomatically backs up mailboxes that have never been backed up
when the next backup is scheduled. This might not be the best option
every time a full backup is required on all mailboxes, such as
immediately after massive mailbox migrations or after a major upgrade.
Enabling *Throttle automatic* *backups* limits the mailbox count in a
daily backup to T/N. This breaks theconstraint of backing up all
mailboxes in N days, but it helps backup to finish during off hours.

.CLI
****
When all mailboxes are backed up at least once, disable
throttling:
[source, bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraBackupAutoGroupedThrottled TRUE
----
****

== Backup and Restore Using the Command Line Interface

The Zimbra backup and restore procedures can be run as CLI commands.

.CLI
****
The following utilities are provided to create backup schedules,
perform full and incremental backups, restore the mail server, or
restore the LDAP server.

* +zmschedulebackup+. This command is used to schedule full backups,
incremental backups, and deletion of old backups.
* +zmbackup+. This command executes full or incremental backup of the mail
server. This is run on a live server, while the mailboxd process and the
mailbox server are running. This command also has an option to manually
delete old backups when they are no longer needed.
* +zmbackupabort+. This command stops a full backup that is in process.
* +zmbackupabort -r+. This command stops an ongoing restore.
* +zmbackupquery+. This command lists the information about ongoing and
completed backups, including labels and dates.
* +zmrestore+. This command executes a full or incremental restore to the
Zimbra mail server. The *zmrestore* command is performed on a server
that is running.
* +zmrestoreoffline+. This command restores the Zimbra mail server when
the mailboxd process is stopped.
* +zmrestoreldap+. This command restores the complete LDAP directory
server, including accounts, domains, servers, COS and other data.

Refer to <<appendix_a, Appendix A Command Line Utilities>>
for usage and definitions for each of these commands.
****

== Backing up using the Standard Method

When you initiate a backup, you can issue the command from the same
server being backed up, run the command remotely and specify the target
server on the command line, or use the Administration Console to start a
backup session.

=== Scheduling a Standard Backup

When {product-name} was installed, the backup schedule for the
standard method of full and incremental backups was added to the
crontab. Under the default schedule, the full backup is scheduled for
1:00 a.m., every Saturday. The incremental backups are scheduled for
1:00 a.m., Sunday through Friday.

By default, backups older than a month are deleted every night at 12
a.m.

You can change the backup schedule using the +zmschedulebackup+ command.

Specify the fields as follows, separate each field with a blank space:

* minute — 0 through 59
* hour — 0 through 23
* day of month — 1 through 31
* month — 1 through 12
* day of week — 0 through 7 (0 or 7 is Sunday, or use names)

Type an asterisk (*) in the fields you are not using.

*Example of* +zmschedulebackup+ *options*

* Replace the existing full backup, incremental backup and delete backup
schedule. When you use +-R+, the complete backup schedule is replaced. If
you use this command, remember to set the delete schedule, if you want
backup sessions to be scheduled for automatic deletion. This example
replaces the existing schedule to have full backups run on Sunday at 1
a.m., incremental backups to run Monday through Saturday at 1 a.m., and
old backups deleted at 12:00 a.m. every day.
+
[source, bash]
----
zmschedulebackup -R f "0 1 * * 7" i "0 1 * * 1-6" d 1m "0 0 * * *"
----

* Add an additional full backup time to your current schedule. This
example adds a full backup on Thursday at 1 a.m.
+
[source, bash]
----
zmschedulebackup -A f "0 1 * * 4"
----
* Review your backup schedule. The schedule is displayed.
+
[source, bash]
----
zmschedulebackup -q
----
* Save the schedule command to a text file. This would allow you to
easily recreate the same schedule after reinstall or upgrade
+
[source, bash]
----
zmschedulebackup -s
----

[NOTE]
If you change the default schedule and want to return to it,
enter the command +zmschedulebackup -D+.

==== Default Standard Backup Schedule

The default backup schedule is displayed similarly to the following
example:

.Default Backup Schedule
======================================================
[source,bash]
0 1 * * 6 /opt/zimbra/bin/zmbackup -f - all
0 1* * 0-5 /opt/zimbra/bin/zmbackup -i
0 0 * * * /opt/zimbra/bin/zmbackup -del 1m
======================================================

Read as follows:

.The full backup runs on 1 a.m. on Saturdays
[source,bash]
----
0 1 * * * 6 /opt/zimbra/bin/zmbackup -f - all
----


.An incremental backup runs at 1 a.m. from Sunday through Friday
[source,bash]
----
0 1* * 0-5 /opt/zimbra/bin/zmbackup -i
----

.Backup sessions are deleted at midnight 1 month after they were created.
[source,bash]
----
0 0 * * * /opt/zimbra/bin/zmbackup -del 1m
----


.How to read the crontable
****
Each crontab entry contains six fields that appear in this order:

[options="header",]
|=======================================================================
6+|Field
|*1* |*2* |*3* |*4* |*5* |*6*
|*0* |*1* |* |* |*6* |+/opt/zimbra/bin/zmbackup -f -all+
|=======================================================================

. minute (0-59 allowed)
. hour (0-23)
. day of month (1-31)
. month (1-12 or names)
. day of week (0-7 or names allowed, with both 0 and 7 representing
Sunday
. string to be executed

[NOTE]
The asterisk character works as a wild card, representing every
occurrence of the field’s value.
****

You can add additional recipient addresses or change the notification email
address in the Administration Console *Global Settings>Backup/Restore*
page.

=== Full Backup Process

The full backup process goes through the following steps to backup the
mailbox, the database, the indexes, and the LDAP directory:

. Backs up the global system data including system tables and the
local config.xml file.
. Iterates through each account to be backed up and backs up the LDAP
entries for those accounts.
. Places the account’s mailbox in maintenance mode to temporarily
block mail delivery and user access to that mailbox.
. Backs up the mailbox.
.. Creates MySQL dump for all data related to that mailbox.
.. Backs up the message directory for that mailbox.
.. Creates a backup of the index directory for that mailbox.
. Returns that account’s mailbox to active mode and moves on to the
next one.
. Backs up the LDAP directory.

Full backup is usually run asynchronously. When you begin the full
backup, the label of the ongoing backup process is immediately
displayed. The backup continues in the background. You can use the
+zmbackupquery+ command to check the status of the running backup at any
time.

Backup files are saved as zip files without compression. To change the
default zip option, see <<appendix_a, Appendix A Command Line Interface>>,
zmbackup section.

=== Incremental Backup Process

Incremental backups are run using the CLI command, *zmbackup*. The
process for incremental backup is as follows:

. Backs up the global system data including system tables and the
local +config.xml+.

. Iterates through each account to be backed up and backs up the LDAP
entries for those accounts.

. Moves the archive redo logs, created since the last backup, to the
+<backup target>/redologs+ directory.
+
Archived logs that are less than an hour old at the time of incremental
backup are copied to the backup and are not deleted. These redologs are
deleted one hour after the backup. The interval is set by the
localconfig key +backup_archived_redolog_keep_time+. The default is 3600
seconds.
+
If no full backup for this account is found, the backup process performs
a full backup on this account, even if only an incremental backup was
specified.

.  Backs up the LDAP directory.

==== Performing Manual Backups

.CLI
****
Use the zmbackup command to perform the following backup
operations:

* Perform a manual back up all mailboxes on server<1>:
[source,bash]
----
zmbackup -f -s server1.domain.com -a all
----
* Perform a manual, incremental backup of all mailboxes on *server1*
since last full backup
[source,bash]
----
zmbackup -i -s server1.domain.com -a all
----
* Perform a manual, full backup of only *user1’s* mailbox on *server1*
[source,bash]
----
zmbackup -f -s server1.domain.com -a user1@domain.com
----
****

==== Deleting Backup Sessions

You can delete backup sessions either by label or by date.

* Deleting by label deletes that session and all backup sessions before
that session.
* Deleting by date deletes all backup session prior to the specified
date.

.CLI
****
For example, +zmbackup -del 7d+ deletes backups older than 7 days
from now. You can specify day (+d+), month (+m+), or year (+y+).
****

=== Finding a Specific Backups

Each full or incremental backup is a backup session.

Each backup session is labeled with date and time. For example, the
label +full-20070712.155951.123+ says this is a backup from July 12,
2007 at 3:59:51.123.

[NOTE]
The times set in the session label are GMT, not the local time. GMT is used
rather than local time to preserve visual ordering across daylight savings
transitions.

.CLI
****
Use the +zmbackupquery+ command to find full backup sessions.

* To find a specific full backup session:
[source,bash]
----
zmbackupquery -lb full-20070712.155951.123
----
* To find a full backup sessions since a specific date:
[source,bash]
----
zmbackupquery --type full --from "2007/01/01 12:45:45"
----
* To find all full backup sessions in the backup directory:
[source,bash]
----
zmbackupquery --type full
----
* To find the best point in time to restore for an account specify a
time window
[source,bash]
----
zmbackupquery -a user1@example.com --type full --from "2007/07/05 12:01:15" --to "2007/07/12 17:01:45"
----
****

[NOTE]
If a backup session is interrupted because the server crashes during backup
(not aborted), the interrupted backup session is saved as a temporary
session. The temporary backup session is put in +<backup
target>/sessions_tmp+ directory. You can use the +rm+ command to delete the
directory.

== Aborting a Full Backup in Progress

. Before you can abort a backup, you must know the backup session
label. This label is displayed when +zmbackup+ first starts. If you do not
know the full backup label, use +zmbackupquery+ to find the label.

.  Use the +zmbackupabort+ command to stop a backup that is in progress.
The backup is immediately stopped and becomes a partially successful
backup.
+
* Stop the backup, if you know the label name
[source,bash]
----
zmbackupabort -lb full-20070712.155951.123 -s server1
----
* Stop the backup, if you do not know the label
[source,bash]
----
zmbackupquery
zmbackupabort -s server1 -lb full-20070712.155951.123
----

== Back up using the Auto-Grouped Method

The auto-grouped backup method is configured either from the
Administration Console or from the CLI.

.Admin Console
****
*Configure> Global Settings*, *Backup/Restore* page, or,
to set it by servers:

*Configure> Servers* <server> *Backup/Restore* page.
****

=== Configuring Auto-Grouped Backup from the CLI

Set the backup method in the global configuration, and you can override
the configuration on a per server basis if you do not want a particular
server to use the auto-grouped backup method.

.CLI
****
To set up auto-grouped backup, you modify LDAP attributes with
the zmprov command:
[source, bash]
----
zmprov mcf <ldap_attribute> <arg>
----
You can also set the attributes at the server level using +zmprov ms+.

The following LDAP attributes are modified:

* +zimbraBackupMode+. Set it to be *Auto-Grouped*. The default is
Standard.
* +zimbraBackupAutoGroupedInterval+. Set this to the interval in either
days or weeks that backup sessions should run for a group. The default
is 1d. Backup intervals can be 1 or more days, entered as xd (1d); or 1
or more weeks, entered as xw (1w).
* +zimbraBackupAutoGroupedNumGroups+. This is the number of groups to
spread mailboxes over. The default is 7 groups.
****

=== Schedule Auto-Group Backups

You must configure the auto-group backup schedule.

.CLI
****
Run +zmschedulebackup -D+ to set the default schedule for
auto-grouped backups based on your +zimbraBackupAutoGroupedInterval+
setting.

One group is backed up each interval. The auto- grouped backup
automatically adjusts for changes in the number of mailboxes on the
server. Each backup session backs up the following:

* All mailboxes that have never been backed up before. These are newly
provisioned mailboxes.
* All mailboxes that have not been backed within the number of scheduled
backup days. For example, if backups are scheduled to run over six days,
mailboxes that have not been backed up in the past 5 days are backed up.
* More mailboxes, the oldest backup first. This is done so that the
daily auto-grouped backup load is balanced.
+
For example, if you configured the auto-grouped backup interval to be
daily (1d) and the number of groups to be 7, the first time auto-grouped
backup runs, all accounts are backed up. After the initial backup,
auto-grouped backup runs again the next day. This time accounts that
have been newly provisioned and a percentage of accounts close to
one-seventh of the total are backed up again. Accounts with the oldest
backup date are backed up first. The backup continues with newly
provisioned account and approximately one-seventh of accounts being
backed up daily over seven days.
****

When backing up shared messages, if a file representing a message
already exists in the backup, it flags this object as such and does not
copy its content again.

Backup files are saved as zip files without compression. To change the
default zip option, see <<appendix_a, Appendix A Command Line Interface>>, zmbackup
section.

These backup files can be used to restore the complete {product-name}
system or individual mailboxes so that account and message data is
completely restored. Archived redo logs are moved to the backup session as
part of the full backup. When the server is restored from an auto-grouped
backup, redo logs are replayed to bring the system to the point before the
failure.

== Backup Options

The backup process can be configured to selectively back up content and
to backup the MySQL database.

=== Backup Up content Options

You can configure these backup options so that search indexes, blobs,
and HSM blobs are not backed up during a full backup session.

* +zimbraBackupSkipSearchIndex+. Default is *FALSE*. If set to *TRUE*,
search index is not backed up. The mailbox will have to be reindexed
after restoring from a backup without the search index.
* +zimbraBackupSkipBlobs+. The default is *FALSE*. If this is set to
*TRUE*, blobs are not backed up. This might be useful for getting a
quicker backup of just database data when the blobs reside on a
fault-tolerant storage. This configuration applies to all blobs, those
on the primary volumes as well as secondary (HSM) volumes.
* +zimbraBackupSkipHsmBlobs+. The default is false. If this is set to
true, blobs on HSM volumes are no backed up. Set this if
+zimbraBackupSkipBlobs+ is false but you want to skip blobs on HSM
volumes.

=== Back Up the MySQL Database

You can configure {product-name} backups to run mysqldump to
backup your MySQL database during backup sessions. When this is enabled,
a mysqldump backup runs with each full, incremental, and auto-grouped
backup.

The mysqldump is a backup of your MySQL database at a specific time.
Data changes that occur later than the dump file are written to the
binary log.To recover to a specific point in time, binary logging must
be enabled. See the Zimbra wiki article, MySQL Backup and Restore at
https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/MySQL_Backup_and_Restore.

The MySQL dump files are gzipped and placed in the backup target
directory, or to +/opt/zimbra/backup+, if no directory is specified.

These files can be quite large. Make sure that the free disk space is at
least three times greater than the actual mySQL database file for each
mySQL database backup file that is saved.

* Enable mysqldump to run automatically with your backups, type
[source, bash]
----
zmlocalconfig edit mysql_backup_retention=<N>
----
*N* is the number of copies of the mySQL database backups that
areretained.

[NOTE]
To restore a MySQL database, contact Zimbra support for assistance.

== Managing Disk Space for Backups

Backup sessions fail if the target disk does not have enough space. All
data backed up in the backup session is discarded and deleted.

You can choose to receive notification when your disk might not have
enough space to complete the backup

.CLI
****
Configuring the +zimbraBackupMinFreeSpace+ attribute helps you
manage running backup session by notifying you.

Set the value for attribute +zimbraBackupMinFreeSpace+ to the amount of
free space required on the backup target disk before a backup session is
run. If the disk has less space than the value set in the attribute, the
backup session will not run and an email notification is sent to the
administrator.

[NOTE]
If you are also backing up the MySQL database, make sure you set the value
large enough to include the myslqdump file size.

The value for this attribute can be specified as a percentage of the
total disk space, for example 25%, or as number of bytes, for example
300MB, 50GB, etc. The default value is 0, meaning the check is disabled
and backup is always allowed to start.
****

.CLI
****
The attribute can be set globally or by server.

* As global:
[source, bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraBackupMinFreeSpace <value>
----
* By server:
[source, bash]
----
zmprov ms <zmhostname> zimbraBackupMinFreeSpace <value>
----

Backup sessions run if the free disk space is at least the value you
set. If your backup file is larger than the value, the backup session
fails. You should monitor the size of the backup files and adjust the
attribute value if the backup require more space than the configured
value.
****

== Restoring Data

Three types of restore procedures can be run:

.CLI
****

The `zmrestore` command is used to restore the mailboxes while the
{product-name} mailbox server is running.

* +zmrestoreoffline+ — to restore the mail server when the mail server is
down. This command is run for disaster recovery.
* +zmrestoreldap+ — to restore the content of the LDAP directory server.

The restore process allows all accounts or individual accounts to be
specified.
****

=== Restore Process

The *zmrestore* process goes through the following steps to restore the
mailbox, the database, the indexes, and the LDAP directory.

.  Retrieves specified accounts to be restored, or specify *all* for
all accounts that have been backed up.
.  Iterates through each mailbox:
..  Deletes the mailbox on the server to clear any existing data
..  Restores the last full backup of the MySQL data, the index directory,
and the message directory for that mailbox
..  Replays redo logs in all incremental backups since last full backup
..  Replays all archived redo logs for that mailbox, from the redo log
archive area on the mailbox server
..  Replays the current redo log

[NOTE]
Accounts are restored, even if the account exceeds its quota.  The next
time the user performs an action that affects quota, they receive a warning
that they have exceeded their quota.

[IMPORTANT]
Users using the Zimbra Connector for Microsoft Outlook must perform an
initial sync on the Outlook client when they log on after the Zimbra server
is restored.

*Examples*

.Perform a full restore of all accounts on server1
====
Including last full backup and any incremental backups since last full backup
[source, bash]
----
zmrestore -a all
----
====

.Perform a single account restore on server1
====
[source, bash]
----
zmrestore -a account@company.com
----
====

.Restore to a specific point in time (PIT)
====
The following restore options affect redo log replay. If you do not specify
one of these options, all redo logs since the full backup you're restoring
from are replayed

[IMPORTANT]
After you perform any of the following point-in-time restores,you should
immediately run a complete backup for those accounts to avoid future
restore problems with those accounts.

A restore that is run using any of the following options is a
point-in-time restore:

* +-restoreToTime+ *<arg>* - Replay the redo logs until the time
specified.
* +-restoreToIncrLabel+ *<arg>* - Replay redo logs up to and including
this incremental backup.
* +-restoreToRedoSeq+ *<arg>* - Replay up to and including this
redo log sequence.
* +-br+ - Replays the redo logs in backup only, therefore excluding
archived and current redo logs of the system.
* +-rf+ - Restores to the full backup only. This does not include any
incremental backups at all.
====

.Specify an exact time, the incremental backup label, or the redo log sequence to restore to.
====
Restore stops at the earliest possible point in time if more than one point
in time restore options are specified.
[source, bash]
----
zmrestore -a account@company.com-restoreToTime <arg>
----
Two common ways to write the <timearg> are

* +"YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss"+
* +YYYYMMDD.hhmmss+
====

.Perform an incremental restore only to last full backup, excluding incremental backups since then, for all accounts
====
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore -rf --a all
----
====

.Restore mailbox and LDAP data for an account
====
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore -ra -a account@company.com
----
====

.Restore to a new target account
====
A prefix is prepended to the original account names
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore -ca -a account@company.com -pre restore
----
The result from the above example would be an account called
restoreaccount@company.com.
====

.Restore system tables in the database (db) and the local config
====
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore -sys
----
====

.Include +--contineOnError+ (+-c+) to the command so that the restore process continues if an error is encountered.
====
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore -a all -c
----
When +-c+ is designated, accounts that could not be restored are displayed
when the restore process is complete.
====

.Restore a specific account
====
Can also be used to restore deleted accounts
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore -a account@company.com
----
====

.Avoid restoring accounts that were deleted
====
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore -a account@company.com -skipDeletedAccounts
----
====

.Restore a mailbox, but exclude all the delete operations that were in the redolog replay
====

When the mailbox is restored it will contain messages that were
deleted. This is useful if users use POP and remove messages from the
server
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore -a account@company.com --skipDeletes
----
[NOTE]
When the latest point in time is requested, do not add a backup label
(+-lb+). Without specifying the label, the most recent full backup before the
requested point is automatically used as the starting point.
====

=== Stop a Restore Process

The +zmbackupabort -r+ command interrupts a restore that is in process.
The restore process stops after the current account finishes being
restored. The command displays a message showing which accounts were not
restored.

To stop the restore type:
[source,bash]
----
zmbackupabort -r
----

=== Restore Mailboxes When Mail Server Is Down

The offline restore process can only be run when the mailboxd server is
not running. In general, offline restore is run under the following
circumstances:

* Certain components of the Zimbra server are corrupted, and the server
cannot be started. For example, the data in LDAP or the database are
corrupted.
* A disaster requires the Zimbra software to be reinstalled on the
server.

The offline restore must be run before the {product-name} mailbox
store server is started to keep the redo logs in sequence.

In a disaster recovery when the Zimbra software is reinstalled, if mailboxd
is started before the backup files are restored, the mail server would
begin to accept email messages and perform other activities, producing redo
logs in the process. Since the pre-disaster data have not been restored to
the server, the redo logs would be out of sequence. Once mailboxd is
running, it would be too late to restore the pre-disaster data.

The offline restore process goes through the following steps.

. Specified accounts to be restored are retrieved. If the command-line
does not specify any mailbox address, the list of all mailboxes on the
specified mail host are retrieved from Zimbra LDAP directory server.
. Iterates through each mailbox:
.. Deletes the mailbox on the server to clear any existing data
.. Restores the last full backup of the MySQL data, the index
directory, and the message directory for that mailbox
.. Replays redo logs in all incremental backups since last full backup
.. Replays all archived redo logs for that mailbox, from the redo log
archive area on the mailbox server
.. Replays the current redo log

==== Restore All Accounts

. Restore all accounts on server1 when mailboxd is stopped
+
[source,bash]
----
zmrestoreoffline -a all
----
. Start mailboxd after the offline restore is complete
+
[source,bash]
----
zmcontrol startup
----

=== Restore Individual Accounts on a Live System

Use the *zmrestore* command to restore one or more selected accounts. In
the event that a user’s mailbox has become corrupted, you might want to
restore that user from the last full and incremental backup sets.

. For each account to be restored, put the account into maintenance mode
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov ma <account> zimbraAccountStatus maintenance
----
+
Maintenance mode prevents delivery of new emails during the restore.
Otherwise, the emails would be overwritten during the restore process.

. Run the +zmrestore+ command to restore the accounts
+
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore -a account@abc.com
----

.  For each account that was restored, put the account back into active mode
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov ma <account> zimbraAccountStatus active
----

[IMPORTANT]
If a user account is restored and the COS that the account was assigned no
longer exists, the default COS is assigned to the account.

=== Exclude Items from a Restore

When you restore from a full backup, you can exclude the search index
and blobs.

* *Search index*. If you do not restore the search index data, the
mailbox willhave to be reindexed after the restore.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore -a <all|account> --exclude-search-index
----

* *Blobs*. This is a useful option when all blobs for the mailbox being
restoredalready exists.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore <all or account>|--exclude-blobs
----

* *HSM-blobs*. This is useful when all HSM blobs for the mailbox
beingrestored already exists.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore <all or account> --exclude-hsm-blobs
----

=== Restore the LDAP Server

In a disaster recovery where you need to restore the entire system,
restore the LDAP directory server first.

The zmrestoreldap command restores the global LDAP data including COS,
distribution lists, etc. You can restore the complete LDAP server, which
recreates the entire schema or you can restore specific accounts. You
specify the session to restore. The restore command has to be run on the
LDAP server being restored.

*Examples*

.Find the LDAP session labels
====
[source,bash]
----
zmrestoreldap -lbs
----
====

.Restore the complete LDAP directory server
====
[source,bash]
----
zmrestoreldap -lb full20061130135236
----
====

.Restore LDAP data for specific accounts
====
[source,bash]
----
zmrestoreldap -lb full20061130135236 -a tac@abc.com jane@abc.com
----
====

== General Steps for Disaster Recovery

Use the following steps to restore a mailbox store server in a general
disaster scenario involving multiple machines.

=== Preparation

.  Restore the LDAP directory server to a known good state before doing
anything with the mailbox store server.
.  Put all mailboxes into maintenance mode to prevent mail delivery and
user login while restoring the mailboxes.
.  Stop the mailbox store server if it is running.

=== Recovery

.  Reinstall the {product-name} software on the mailbox server,
if necessary.
.  Restore mailboxes.
.  Start the {product-name} server.
.  Put all {product-name} mailboxes back in active mode.
.  Run a full backup of the server.

=== Crash Recovery Server Startup

When your system unexpectedly stops and then restarts on startup, the
server searches the redo log for uncommitted transactions and replays
any that it finds. Replaying the redo logs brings the system to a
consistent state.

=== Restore the {product-name}

If a complete machine failure occurs, use the following steps to restore
to a new server.

[IMPORTANT]
The {product-name} version you install on the new server *must be the
same version* as installed on the old server.  The server can have a
different operating system.

The new server hardware must meet the requirements described in the
Installation Prerequisites section of the {product-name} Single
Server Installation guide. Install the new operating system, making any
necessary OS configuration modifications as described in the
installation guide.

You do the following to restore to a new server:

.  Prepare the new server.
.  Block client access to the old server’s IP address with firewall
rules.
.  Mount any volumes that were in use on the older server.
.  Delete the MySQL data that is set up in the initial installation of
{product-name}.
.  Copy the backup files to the new server.
.  Run +zmrestoreldap+ to restore the global LDAP data.
.  Run +zmrestoreoffline+ to restore account data from the backup
sessions.
.  Prepare and run a new backup.

==== Old Server Status

Two scenarios for disaster recovery are the server has died and the
{product-name} files cannot be accessed, or {product-name}
is still running, but the server hardware needs to be replaced.

*If the server is not running:*

.  Block client access to the server IP address with firewall rules.
.  Find the latest full {product-name} backup session to use.

*If server is still running, to prepare the move to the new server:*

.  Block client access to the server’s IP address with firewall rules.
.  Run a full backup of the old service, or if the backup is recent,
run an incremental backup to get the most current incremental backup
session.
.  Run +zmcontrol stop+, to stop {product-name}. In order to
restore to the most current state, no new mail should be received after
the last incremental backup has run.
.  Change the hostname and IP address on the old server to something
else. Do not turn off the server.

=== Install {product-abbrev} on a New Server

Before you begin, make sure that the new server is correctly configured
with the IP address and hostname and that {product-name} is
installed and configured with the same domain, hostname, passwords, etc.
as the previous server. See the {product-name} installation guide
for more information about preparing the server. Before you begin to
install {product-name}, note the information you need from the old
server including: admin account name and password, LDAP, Amavis, and
Postfix passwords, spam training and non-spam training user account
names, exact domain name, and the global document account name.

[NOTE]
Make sure the computer time is set to the same time as the old
server. Verify that the old hostname and MX DNS records resolve to the new
server.

.  Copy the {product-name} License.xml file to a directory on the
new server. You cannot complete the {product-name} installation if
the license is not on the new server.
.  Run +./install.sh+ and follow the directions in the installation guide
to install {product-name}. Make sure that you configure the same
domain, hostname, passwords as on the old server. During Zimbra
Collaboration install, the following settings must be changed to match
the original server settings:
..  *Zimbra LDAP Server*. For *Domain to create*, identify the same
defaultdomain as on the old server.
..  *Zimbra Mailbox Server*. An administrator’s account is
automaticallycreated.
* Make sure that the account name for *Admin user to create* is the same
name as on the original server.
* Set the admin password to be the same as on the old server.
* Set the LDAP password to be the same as on the old server.
* Set the Postfix user and Amavis user passwords to be the same as on
the old server
* Change the *Spam training user* and the *Non-spam (HAM) training*
*user* account names to be the same as the spam account names onthe old
server.
* *Global Document Account* – This account name is
automatically generated and is usually named wiki. If you changed this,
change the Global Document Account name to be the same account name as
on the original server.
..  Change any other settings on the new server to match the
configuration on the original server.
..  In the main menu, set the default backup schedule and the automatic
starting of servers after the configuration is complete to *NO*.

==== Restoring a Backup to a New Server

.  Stop the new server
+
[source,bash]
----
zmcontrol stop
----

.  If the old server had additional storage volumes configured, mount
the additional volumes now.

.  Delete the mysql data and reinitialize an empty data directory. If
you do not do this, zmrestoreoffline will have errors. As zimbra, type
+
[source,bash]
----
rm -rf /opt/zimbra/db/data/* /opt/zimbra/libexec/zmmyinit
----
+
The mySQL service is now running.

.  Copy all the files in the +/backup+ directory from the old server or
from an archive location to +/opt/zimbra/backup+.

.  Restore the LDAP.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmrestoreldap -lb <latest_label>
----
+
If you are restoring a large number of accounts, you might run a command
such as the UNIX command, nohup, so that the session does not terminate
before the restore is complete.
+
[NOTE]
To find the LDAP session label to restore, type +zmrestoreldap –lbs+.

.  Because some {product-name} services are running at this
point, type +zmconvertctl start+. This is required before running
+zmrestoreoffline+.

.  Sync your LDAP password from backup directory to the new production
servers LDAP config.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -f -e zimbra_ldap_password=<password>
----

.  Start the offline restore.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmrestoreoffline -sys -a all -c -br
----
+
You might run a command such as nohup here also. To watch the progress,
tail +/opt/zimbra/log/mailbox.log+.
+
[NOTE]
Use +–c+ on the command line so that accounts are restored,
even if some accounts encounter errors during the offline restore
process.

.  Because some {product-name} services are running at this
point, type +zmcontrol stop+ to stop all services.

.  Remove any old backup sessions because these sessions are no longer
valid.
+
[source,bash]
----
rm -rf /opt/zimbra/redolog/* /opt/zimbra/backup/*
----

.  Start {product-name}.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmcontrol start
----

.  Run a full backup.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmbackup -f -a all
----

. Remove the firewall rules and allow client access to the new
server.

=== Restoring from Different Failure Scenarios

The restoration steps are similar for most server failures you may
encounter. If a failure occurs, review the disaster recovery section to
understand the process and then follow the steps below for the specific
type of failure.

==== Restore When LDAP is Corrupted

.  Reinstall the LDAP server. See the {product-name} Installation
guide.
.  Find the label for the LDAP session to restore. Run the
+zmrestoreldap - lb <label>+ command, with no arguments to restore all
accounts, domains, servers, COS, etc. for the LDAP server.
.  Make sure that all accounts are in active mode. From the command
line, type +zmprov ma zimbraAccountStatus active+

==== Restore After Replacing Corrupted Partitions

.  If a partition becomes corrupted, replace the failed disk.
.  To restore the latest full and incremental backup files, run
+
[source,bash]
----
zmrestore -a all
----
+
The *zmrestore* process automatically retrieves the list of all
mailboxes on the specified mail host from the backup date and iterates
through each mailbox to restore the mailboxes to the last known good
state.

==== Restore After Corrupted or Unreadable Redo Log

If the redo log becomes unreadable, the mailboxd service stops and
cannot restart. If this happens, inspect the hardware and software to
find the source of the problem before proceeding.

Without the latest redo log, the Zimbra mailbox server cannot be
returned to the most current state. The Zimbra mailbox data can be
restored to the latest archived redo log state. A new redo log for
current transactions is created after the Zimbra mailbox server is
restored.

[IMPORTANT]
The mailboxd service must not be running, and all accounts must be in
maintenance mode before beginning.

.  Put all accounts into maintenance mode.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmprov md <domain> zimbraDomainStatus maintenance
----

.  With the mailboxd service not running, type
+
[source,bash]
----
zmrestoreoffline
----
+
The offline restore process begins by retrieving the list of all
mailboxes on the specified mail host from the backup.
+
The offline restore than iterates through each mailbox to:
+
--
* Delete the mailboxes on the server
* Restore the last full backup from the backup area
* Restore all incremental backups for that mailbox in order, since the
last full backup. This involves replaying the redo logs from the backup
target area
* Replay all archived redo logs
--
+
Because the redo log for current transactions is not available, the
mailbox server is returned to the state of the last archived redo log.

.  After the offline restore is complete, start {product-abbrev}.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmcontrol startup
----

.  When the Zimbra mailbox server is up, run a full backup of the
Zimbra server. The full backup must be run immediately to have the
latest data backed up, because the latest redo log is not available.

=== Change Local Configuration Files After Restoring Zimbra

The +localconfig.xml+ file, located in the +/opt/zimbra/conf+ directory,
includes the core Zimbra server configuration, such as paths and passwords,
This file is backed up in full and incremental backups. When you run an
incremental or full restore, the backed-up version of the +localconfig.xml+
is renamed localconfig.xml.restore and is copied to the +/opt/zimbra/conf+
directory.

If you have made changes since the last backup, you might need to replace
the localconfig.xml file with the restored copy. Compare these files, and
if the *.restore* file has the latest local configuration data, delete the
localconfig.xmlfile and rename the file with the +.restore+ extension to
localconfig.xml.

== Using snapshots to Backup and Restore

You can back up and restore a server using the snapshot feature provided
by the storage layer rather than using Zimbra’s backup and restore
feature. Using snapshots, you can maintain a standby site if the primary
site fails and reroute users to the standby site to keep operations
running.

Snapshots are taken for all volumes of data and are transferred to the
standby site periodically. Data volumes that are backed up using
snapshots include mysql, blobs, lucene index, and redologs.

When the primary site is down, the zmplayredo command is used to bring
consistency to the snapshots and to reapply any changes in data to
minimize data loss across volumes

There are four volumes of data:

* Mysql
* Blob
* Lucene index
* Redologs

Sets of snapshots are taken every hour and transferred to the remote
standby site. However, all snapshots are not taken at one instant and
could be a second to a minute apart from each other. Also, snapshots of
redologs may be taken more frequently. The sequence of events could look
like:

+8:00:00+ - snapshot mysql

+8:00:01+ - snapshot blob

+8:00:02+ - snapshot index

+8:00:03+ - snapshot redolog

+8:05:00+ - transfer the snapshot set to remote site completed

...

+8:15:00+ - snapshot redolog

+8:15:05+ - transfer of redolog snapshot to remote site completed

...

+8:30:00+ - snapshot redolog

+8:30:05+ - transfer of redolog snapshot to remote site completed

...

+8:35:00+ - primary site fails

On the remote site, there are snapshots from the 8:00 set of data as
well as subsequent snapshots of the redologs. They all have to be
brought together so that the most recent information is available on the
standby site once users are rerouted to it.

You can now run the +zmplayredo+ command to replay changes from 8:00:00.

[source,bash]
----
zmplayredo --fromTime "2008/10/17 08:00:00:000"
----

All data is brought forward to the current time and the standby site is
set up and running. Data from 8:30:00 to 8:35:00 is lost but that is
expected when the restore process is being carried out.
