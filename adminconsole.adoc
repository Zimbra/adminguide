= Zimbra Administration Console
:toc:

The Zimbra Administration Console is a browser-based user interface for the central management of Zimbra servers and user accounts.

== Administrator Accounts

When you log in to the Administration Console, the tasks you are authorized to perform show up on the Navigation pane.
These tasks depend on the rights assigned to your administrator role.

You can create two types of administrator accounts to manage {product-name}:

* *Global Administrators* have full privileges to manage servers,
global settings, domains, and accounts as well as create other administrators.
One global administrator account gets created automatically during software installation.
Create additional global administrator accounts anytime later.
You can perform administration tasks from the Administration Console or the command line.

* *Delegated Administrators* are granted customized administrator roles by the global administrator to manage different tasks from the Administration Console.
See <<delegated_administration,Delegated Administration>> for more details.

== Logging into the Administration Console

. To launch the Administration Console in a typical installation, use the following URL pattern.
+
`\https://server.domain.com:7071/`
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|====================================================
|Parameter |Description
|server.domain.com |The Zimbra server name or IP address.
|7071 |The default HTTP listen port.
|====================================================

. At the login screen, enter the complete administrator address - e.g., *admin@domain.com* - and the password configured for it during server installation of {product-name}.
+
image::administration_console.png[Administration Console]

=== Modifying Administrator Passwords

You can change the password - from either the Administration Console or the CLI - at any time.

From the Administration Console, use the *Change Password* screen to set the new password string, and to define the policy for user password modifications.

Admin Console: ::
*Home -> Manage -> Accounts*

Double click select _user account_ *or* from the *Gear* icon, select *Change Password* from the popup menu.

image::administration_console_password.png[Change Password]

[source,bash]
----
zmprov sp adminname@domain.com password
----

=== Customizing the Login and Logout Pages

A different login and logout page can be configured either as a global setting or as a domain setting.

To specify a URL to redirect administrators to if their login fails authentication, or if their authentication has expired:

Global:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraAdminConsoleLoginURL <https://example.com>
----

Domain:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov md <domain> zimbraAdminConsoleLoginURL <https://example.com>
----

To specify a URL to redirect administrators to, for logging out:

Global:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraAdminConsoleLogoutURL <https://example.com>
----

Domain:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov md <domain> zimbraAdminConsoleLogoutURL <https://example.com>
----

== Managing Tasks

Most {product-short} tasks - such as creating accounts and Classes of Service, Server Status Monitoring, Domain management, Backup Scheduling, and Session management - can be managed from the Administration Console.

Other configuration and maintenance tasks require the use of the Zimbra CLI because you cannot perform them in the Administration Console.
For example: starting and stopping services and managing the local server configuration.

At the Administration Console, if you need to view the attribute associated with a particular function, you can click on the text labels of the currently visible configuration page to open the information in a popup.
Guide text is also provided from these popups, as demonstrated in the following illustration.

== Navigating the User Interface

The organization of the {product-name} Administration Console provides quick navigation to the configuration and monitoring tools and views associated with your login privileges.
It also provides easy access to various types of *Help* and the on-screen guide text.

After logging in to the Administration Console, the *Home* page provides status information and options you can select to navigate to the configuration and viewing options described in this user guide.

[[popup_menu_options]]
=== Popup Menu Options

You can select options to perform on a selected entity from the navigation pane from the Gear icon or a topical popup menu.

[[using_the_gear_icon]]
==== Using the Gear icon

The *Gear* icon is always located at the upper-right edge of the page view if pertinent to selectable items in the displayed page.

image::administration_console_gear_icon.png[The Gear Icon]

To view the available options, highlight a topic at the navigation pane or in the page view: 
In the popup, the options that do not apply to your selection are disabled -- the remaining enabled options are valid with your selection.
The following example demonstrates Gear options based on the selection of a navigation bar topic, versus a table row entry from within the same page view.

=== Containers

The Administration Console logically groups a wide range of Configuration options into _containers_.
Applicable configuration options inside these containers are listed in the
<<high_level_view_of_administration_console_ui,High-level View of Administration Console UI>>

By default, all containers on a page are opened (expanded).
You can opt to close (collapse) containers - which can free up additional space in a page view - by clicking on btn:[collapse/expand] located at the upper-left edge of the container.
