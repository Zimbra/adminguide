= Zimbra Administration Console
:toc:

The Zimbra Administration Console is a browser-based user interface that
allows you to centrally manage Zimbra servers and user accounts.

== Administrator Accounts

When you log in to the Administration Console, the tasks you are
authorized to perform display on the Navigation pane. These tasks are
based on the rights assigned to the administrator role.

Two types of administrator accounts can be created to manage {product-name}:

* *Global Administrators* have full privileges to manage servers,
globalsettings, domains, and accounts as well as create other
administrators. One global administrator account is created when the
software is installed. Additional global administrator accounts can be
created. You can perform administration tasks from the Administration
Console or the command line.

* *Delegated Administrators* are granted customized administrator roles
by the global administrator to manage different tasks from the
Administration Console.
See also <<delegated_administration,Delegated Administration>> for more details.

== Logging in to the Administration Console

. To launch the Administration Console in a typical installation, use
the following URL pattern.
+
`https://server.domain.com:7071/`
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|====================================================
|Parameter |Description
|server.domain.com |The Zimbra server name or IP address.
|7071 |The default HTTP listen port.
|====================================================

. At the login screen, enter the complete administrator address - as
*admin@domain.com* - and the password that was configured during
serverinstallation of {product-name}.
+
image::images/administration_console.png[Administration Console]

=== Modifying Administrator Passwords

You can change the password - from either the Administration Console or
the CLI - at any time.

From the Administration Console, use the *Change Password* screen to set
the new password string, and to define policy for user password
modifications.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Manage > Accounts*

Double click select _user account_ *or* from the *Gear* icon, select
*Change Password* from the popup menu.

image::images/administration_console_password.png[Change Password]

[source,bash]
----
zmprov sp adminname@domain.com password
----

=== Customizing the Login and Logout Pages

A different login and logout page can be configured either as a global
setting or as a domain setting.

To specify a URL to redirect administrators if their login is not
authenticated, or if authentication has expired:

Global:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraAdminConsoleLoginURL <https://example.com>
----

Domain:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov md <domain> zimbraAdminConsoleLoginURL <https://example.com>
----

To specify a URL to redirect administrators, for logging out:

Global:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraAdminConsoleLogoutURL <https://example.com>
----

Domain:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov md <domain> zimbraAdminConsoleLogoutURL <https://example.com>
----

== Managing Tasks

Most {product-abbrev} tasks - such as creating accounts and Classes of Service, Server
Status Monitoring, Domain management, Backup Scheduling and Session
management - can be managed from the Administration Console.

Other configuration and maintenance tasks cannot be handled from the
Administration Console - such as starting and stopping services and managing
the local server configuration - and require use of the Zimbra CLI.

At the Administration Console, if you need to view the attribute associated
with a particular function, you can click on the text labels of the
configuration page currently in view to view the information in a
popup. Guide text is also provided from these popups, as demonstrated in
the following illustration.

== Navigating the User Interface

The {product-name} Administration Console is organized to provide
quick navigation to the configuration and monitoring tools and views
associated with your login privileges. It also provides easy access to
various types of *Help* and the on-screen guide text.

After logging in to the Administration Console, the *Home* page is
displayed to provide status information and options you can select to
navigate to the configuration and viewing options described in this user
guide.

=== Popup Menu Options

You can select options to perform on a selected entity from the
navigation pane from the Gear icon or a topical popup menu.

[[using_the_gear_icon]]
==== Using the Gear icon

The *Gear* icon is always located at the upper right edge of the page
view if pertinent to selectable items in the displayed page.

image::images/administration_console_gear_icon.png[The Gear Icon]

To view the available options, highlight a topic at the navigation pane or
in the page view: In the popup, the options that are not applicable to your
selection are desensitized: other displayed options can be used with your
selection. The following example demonstrates Gear options based on
selection of a navigation bar topic, versus a table row entry from within
the same page view.

The following table provides a high-level view of the operations derived
from the Gear icon, which vary for particular functions.

==== Using the Topical Popup Menus

You can elect to access options to perform on a selection by using popup
menus:

[NOTE]

=== Containers

A wide range of Configuration options are logically grouped into containers
in the Administration Console. Applicable configuration options inside
these containers are listed in the
<<high_level_view_of_administration_console_ui,High-level View of Administration Console UI>>

By default, all containers in a page are opened (expanded). You can opt to
close (collapse) containers - which can free up additional space in a page
view - by clicking on the collapse/ expand button located at the upper left
edge of the container.
