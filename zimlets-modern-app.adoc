= Configuring Zimlets for Modern Web App

Zimlets are plugins which enhance the {modern-client}'s functionalities.
The zimlets need to be configured and authorized before you can use them with the {modern-client}.

{modern-client} lists only the modern zimlets.

== Default zimlets in {modern-client}

Default Zimlets, for {modern-client}, let users perform the following tasks:

* Restore contacts from previous backups

* Add additional signatures for replies, forwards, or new emails

* Detect dates from given content and provide event list of that day on mouse hover

* Use {product-short} as a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application[progressive web app]

* Subscribe to external calendar feeds

* Add an option in settings to change default client in {product-short}

TIP: Zimlets developed for {modern-client} have *(Modern)* in description.

== Configuring LDAP

This section is a basic guide to configuring the necessary LDAP properties for `zm-oauth-social`.
Assumes basic {product-name} CLI knowledge.

The following examples may be used as a starting point for configuring the required LDAP properties to enable use of the zm-oauth services.

As the {product-name} user, these properties can be applied globally as in the following examples, or applied to specific domains.

=== Basic Info

==== Basic Template For User OAuth Token Configuration

`zimbraOAuthConsumerRedirectUri` is the app's relay during the oauth flow (i.e. where the social media site will send the user with a one-time use code to continue the oauth flow).
The left part of the LDAP value must match the app's whitelist.

----
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerRedirectUri 'https://<zimbra-hostname>:<port>/service/extension/oauth2/authenticate/<client>:<client>'
----

`zimbraOAuthConsumerCredentials` is the app's credentials -- provided by the social media app setup.
`verification_token` may be left out for all clients except Zoom.
These credentials tie the oauth flow to a specific app.
The clientId is used by an end-user to request an oauth code, then the clientId + clientSecret are both used by the {product-name} server to exchange that code for an access_token.

----
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerCredentials '<clientId>:<clientSecret>[:<verification_token>]:<client>'
----

zimbraOAuthConsumerAPIScope is the app's required scopes for the specified auth type (caldav,contact,noop).
These scopes determine what permissions are requested from an authorizing user during the social media site leg of the oauth flow.

----
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerAPIScope '<scope><delimiter><scope><delimiter>. . .:<client>_<type>'
----

=== Client Examples
==== Dropbox Example

NOTE: The following is required configuration for dropbox.

----
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerRedirectUri 'https://your.mail.server.host.here/service/extension/oauth2/authenticate/dropbox:dropbox'
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerCredentials 'yourDropboxClientIdHere:yourDropboxClientSecretHere:dropbox'
----

See <<Setting Up Dropbox>> for instructions on obtaining a *Client Id*, and *Client Secret*.

==== Google Example

NOTE: The following is required basic google configuration.

----
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerRedirectUri 'https://your.mail.server.host.here/service/extension/oauth2/authenticate/google:google'
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerCredentials 'yourGoogleClientIdHere:yourGoogleClientSecretHere:google'
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerAPIScope 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive:google_noop'
----

See <<Setting Up Google Drive>> for instructions on obtaining a *Client Id* and *Client Secret*.

==== Microsoft Example

NOTE: The following is required basic microsoft configuration.

----
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerRedirectUri 'https://your.mail.server.host.here/service/extension/oauth2/authenticate/outlook:outlook'
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerCredentials 'yourMSClientIdHere:yourMSClientSecretHere:outlook'
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerAPIScope 'profile+User.Read+Files.ReadWrite.All:outlook_noop'
----

See <<Setting Up OneDrive>> for instructions on obtaining a Client Id, and Client Secret.

==== Slack Example

NOTE: The following is required configuration for slack. The scopes are only applied when authorization is performed for the noop scope.

----
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerRedirectUri 'https://your.mail.server.host.here/service/extension/oauth2/authenticate/slack:slack'
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerCredentials 'yourSlackClientIdHere:yourSlackClientSecretHere:slack'
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerAPIScope 'groups:write,team:read,users:read,users:read.email,chat:write,mpim:write:slack_noop'
----

See <<Setting Up Slack>> for instructions on obtaining a *Client Id* and *Client Secret*.

==== Zoom Example

NOTE: The following is required configuration for zoom. The scopes are only applied when authorization is performed for the noop scope.

----
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerRedirectUri 'https://your.mail.server.host.here/service/extension/oauth2/authenticate/zoom:zoom'
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerCredentials 'yourZoomClientIdHere:yourZoomClientSecretHere:yourZoomVerificationTokenHere:zoom'
zmprov mcf +zimbraOAuthConsumerAPIScope 'meeting:write:zoom_noop'
zmprov mc default +zimbraProxyAllowedDomains 'api.zoom.us'
----

The last line of the above code block allows {product-name} to perform proxy requests for the Zoom zimlet to the Zoom API on behalf of default class of service {product-name} accounts.
This is necessary for the Zoom Zimlet's basic operations.
If users on other class of services should have access, this may be applied on those as well.

See <<Setting Up Zoom>> for instructions on obtaining a Client Id, Client Secret, and Verification Token.

==== Domain Configuration

==== Details

Configuring the credentials of a single domain will override the credentials inherited from global configuration for that domain. Because of this, it is possible to configure just the credentials, and allow the domain to inherit the redirect uri and scopes if neither of these configurations should differ between the global and domain app.

==== Dropbox Example

NOTE: The following is an example for applying dropbox app credentials, which has no additional scope requirements, on the {product-name} domain `example.zimbra.com`:

----
zmprov md example.zimbra.com +zimbraOAuthConsumerRedirectUri 'https://your.mail.server.host.here/service/extension/oauth2/authenticate/dropbox:dropbox'
zmprov md example.zimbra.com +zimbraOAuthConsumerCredentials 'yourDropboxClientIdHere:yourDropboxClientSecretHere:dropbox'

== Setting up Jitsi Videoconferencing Solution-Beta (Early access)
Jitsi is a fully encrypted, 100% open-source, video conferencing solution. Jitsi integration is available in the Modern Web App allowing end-users to set up video conferencing directly in their calendar; i.e. just click a button to add a Jitsi link to a meeting invite and then launch into that video meeting. 

Administrators must install/enable the zimlet and define what video server instance they plan to use. Administrators can deploy their own Jitsi video server instance. Even if administrators have not set up a Jitsi server instance, the Jitsi integration zimlet can use Jitsi's publicly available free video conferencing solution to schedule meetings for the end users. 

For more information, please visit:

. To set up your own Jitsi server - https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-start

. End-user guide for Jitsi integration zimlet - https://zimbra.github.io/userguide/zcloud/userguide-zcloud.html

IMPORTANT: No configuration changes are required if Jitsi’s publicly available free video conferencing solution is used for setting up events.

Steps to set up your organization's Jitsi server URL in the Jitsi zimlet::

In this example, we will assume your organization's Jitsi server URL as https://my-org-jitsi-server.com.

. The following CLI commands need to be run as zimbra user.
+
[source,bash]
----
su - zimbra
----
. Go to /opt/zimbra/zimlets-deployed/zimbra-zimlet-jitsi.
. Edit config_template.xml and change the value of jitUrl parameter to https://my-org-jitsi-server.com.
. Example of the global block in the file after the update.
+
[source,bash]
----
   <global>
       <property name="jitsiUrl"> https://my-org-jitsi-server.com</property>
   </global>
----

. Execute these commands to apply the changes:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmzimletctl configure config_template.xml
zmprov fc all 
----

NOTE: For already logged in users, they will have to reload the Modern UI to apply configuration changes.
