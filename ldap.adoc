= Zimbra LDAP Service
:toc:

LDAP directory services provide a centralized repository for information
about users and devices that are authorized to use your Zimbra service.
The central repository used for Zimbra's LDAP data is the OpenLDAP
directory server.

[NOTE]
{product-name} supports integration with Microsoft's Active Directory
Server.  Contact support for information on specific directory
implementation scenarios.

The LDAP server is installed when {product-short} is installed.  Each
server has its own LDAP entry that includes attributes specifying operating
parameters.  In addition, a global configuration object sets defaults for
any server whose entry does not specify every attribute.

A subset of these attributes can be modified through the Zimbra
administration console and others through the zmprov commands.

== LDAP Traffic Flow

The LDAP Directory Traffic figure shows traffic between the Zimbra-LDAP
directory server and the other servers in the {product-name} system.  The
Zimbra MTA and the {product-name} mailbox server read from, or write to,
the LDAP database on the directory server.

The Zimbra clients connect through the Zimbra server, which connects to
LDAP.

== LDAP Directory Hierarchy

LDAP directories are arranged in an hierarchal tree-like structure with two
types of branches, the mail branches and the config branch.  Mail branches
are organized by domain.  Entries belong to a domain, such as accounts,
groups, aliases, are provisioned under the domain DN in the directory.  The
config branch contains admin system entries that are not part of a domain.
Config branch entries include system admin accounts, global config, global
grants, COS, servers, mime types, and Zimlets.

The Zimbra LDAP Hierarchy figure shows the Zimbra LDAP hierarchy.  Each
type of entry (object) has certain associated object classes.

image::ldap_directory_hierarchy.png[LDAP Directory Hierarchy]

An LDAP directory entry consists of a collection of attributes and has a
globally unique distinguished name (`dn`).  The attributes allowed for an
entry are determined by the _object classes_ associated with that entry.
The values of the object class attributes determine the schema rules the
entry must follow.

An entry's object class that determines what kind of entry it is, is called
a structural object class and cannot be changed.  Other object classes are
called auxiliary and may be added to or deleted from the entry.

Use of auxiliary object classes in LDAP allows for an object class to be
combined with an existing object class.  For example, an entry with
structural object class *inetOrgPerson*, and auxiliary object class
*zimbraAccount*, would be an account.  An entry with the structural object
class *zimbraServer* would be a server in the Zimbra system that has one or
more Zimbra packages installed.

== {product-name} LDAP Schema

At the core of every LDAP implementation is a database organized using a
schema.

The Zimbra LDAP schema extends the generic schema included with OpenLDAP
software.  It is designed to coexist with existing directory installations.

All attributes and object classes specifically created for {product-name}
are prefaced by "`zimbra`", such as `zimbraAccount` object class or
`zimbraAttachmentsBlocked` attribute.

The following schema files are included in the OpenLDAP implementation:

* core.schema
* cosine.schema
* inetorgperson.schema
* zimbra.schema
* amavisd.schema
* dyngroup.schema
* nis.schema

[NOTE]
You cannot modify the Zimbra schema.


=== {product-name} Objects

[cols="1,2a,1s",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Object |Description |Object class

|Accounts |
Represents an account on the Zimbra mailbox server that can be logged into.
Account entries are either administrators or user accounts.
The object class name is *zimbraAccount*.
This object class extends the *zimbraMailRecipient* object class. +
All accounts have the following properties:

* A name in the format of user@example.domain A unique ID that never changes and is never reused.
* A set of attributes, some of which are user-modifiable (preferences) and others that are only configurable by administrators.
* All user accounts are associated with a domain, so a domain must be created before creating any accounts. |zimbraAccount

|Class of Service (COS) |
Defines the default attributes an account has and what features are allowed
or denied.  The COS controls features, default preference settings, mailbox
quotas, message lifetime, password restrictions, attachment blocking, and
server pools for creation of new accounts.  |zimbraCOS

|Domains |
Represents an email domain such as *example.com* or *example.org*.  A
domain must exist before email addressed to users in that domain can be
delivered.  |zimbraDomain

|Distribution Lists|
Also known as mailing lists, are used to send mail to all members of a list
by sending a single email to the list address.  |zimbraDistributionList

|Dynamic Groups|
Are like distribution lists.  The difference is members of a dynamic group
are dynamically computed by a LDAP search.  The LDAP search filter is
defined in an attribute on the dynamic group entry.

[NOTE]
Both distribution lists and dynamic groups can be used as grantee or target
in the delegated administrator framework.

|zimbraGroup

|Servers |
Represents a particular server in the Zimbra system that has one or more of
the Zimbra software packages installed.  Attributes describe server
configuration information, such as which services are running on the
server.  |zimbraServer

|Global Configuration |
Specifies default values for the following objects: server and domain.  If
the attributes are not set for other objects, the values are inherited from
the global settings.  Global configuration values are required and are set
during installation as part of the Zimbra core package.  These become the
default values for the system.  |zimbraGlobalConfig

|Alias |
Represents an alias of an account, distribution list or a dynamic group.
The *zimbraAliasTarget* attribute points to target entry of this alias
entry.  |zimbraAlias

|Zimlet |
Defines Zimlets that are installed and configured in Zimbra.
|zimbraZimletEntry

|Calendar Resource |
Defines a calendar resource such as conference rooms or equipment that can
be selected for a meeting.  A calendar resource is an account with
additional attributes on the *zimbraCalendarResource* object class.
|zimbraCalendarResource

|Identity |
Represents a persona of a user.  A persona contains the user's identity
such as display name and a link to the signature entry used for outgoing
emails.  A user can create multiple personas.  Identity entries are created
under the user's LDAP entry in the DIT.  |zimbraIdentity

|Data Source|
Represents an external mail source of a user.  Two examples of data source
are POP3 and IMAP.  A data source contains the POP3/IMAP server name, port,
and password for the user's external email account.  The data source also
contains persona information, including the display name and a link to the
signature entry for outgoing email messages sent on behalf of the external
account.  Data Source entries are created under the user's LDAP entry in
the DIT.  |zimbraDataSource

|Signature |
Represents a user's signature.  A user can create multiple signatures.
Signature entries are created under the user's LDAP entry in the DIT.
|zimbraSignature

|=======================================================================

== Account Authentication

Supported authentication mechanisms are Internal, External LDAP, and
External Active Directory.  The authentication method type is set on a
per-domain basis.  If `zimbraAuthMech` attribute is not set, the default is
to use internal authentication.

The internal authentication method uses the Zimbra schema running on the
OpenLDAP server.

The `zimbraAuthFallbackToLocal` attribute can be enabled so that the system
falls back to the local authentication if external authentication fails.
The default is FALSE.

=== Internal Authentication Mechanism

The internal authentication method uses the Zimbra schema running on the
OpenLDAP directory server.  For accounts stored in the OpenLDAP server, the
`userPassword` attribute stores a salted-SHA512 (SSHA512) digest of the user's
password.  The user's provided password is computed into the SSHA digest
and then compared to the stored value.

=== External LDAP and External AD Authentication Mechanism

External LDAP and external Active Directory authentication can be used if
the email environment uses another LDAP server or Microsoft Active
Directory for authentication and Zimbra LDAP for all other
{product-name} related transactions.  This requires that users exist in
both OpenLDAP and in the external LDAP server.

The external authentication methods attempt to bind to the specified LDAP
server using the supplied user name and password.  If this bind succeeds,
the connection is closed and the password is considered valid.

The `zimbraAuthLdapURL` and `zimbraAuthLdapBindDn` attributes are required
for external authentication.

* `zimbraAuthLdapURL` attribute `ldap://ldapserver:port/` identifies the IP
  address or host name of the external directory server, and port is the
  port number.  You can also use the fully qualified host name instead of
  the port number.
+
For example:
+
    ldap://server1:3268
    ldap://exch1.acme.com
+
If it is an SSL connection, use `ldaps:` instead of `ldap:`.  The SSL
certificate used by the server must be configured as a trusted certificate.

* `zimbraAuthLdapBindDn` attribute is a format string used to determine
  which DN to use when binding to the external directory server.
+
During the authentication process, the user name starts out in the
format: *user@example.com*
+
The user name might need to be transformed into a valid LDAP bind `DN`
(distinguished name) in the external directory.  In the case of Active
Directory, that bind `dn` might be in a different domain.

=== Custom Authentication

You can implement a custom authentication to integrate external
authentication to your proprietary identity database.  When an
authentication request comes in, Zimbra checks the designated auth
mechanism for the domain.  If the auth mechanism is set to custom
authentication, Zimbra invokes the registered custom auth handler to
authenticate the user.

To set up custom authentication, prepare the domain for the custom auth and
register the custom authentication handler.

==== Preparing a domain for custom auth

To enable a domain for custom auth, set the domain attribute,
*zimbraAuthMech to custom:\{registered-custom-auth-handler-name}*.

In the following example, "sample" is the name under which custom
authentication is registered.

.Enable a domain for custom authentication
====
[source, bash]
----
zmprov modifydomain {domain|id} zimbraAuthMech custom:sample
----
====

==== Register a custom authentication handler

To register a custom authentication handler, invoke:

[source, java]
----
ZimbraCustomAuth.register( handlerName, handler )
----

in the init method of the extension.

* Class: *com.zimbra.cs.account.ldap.ZimbraCustomAuth*
* Method: `public synchronized static void register (String handlerName, ZimbraCustomAuth handler)`
+
Definitions:
+
** *handlerName* is the name under which this custom auth handler
    isregistered to Zimbra's authentication infrastructure.  This name is
    set in the domain's zimbraAuthMech attribute of the domain.
** *handler* is the object on which the authenticate method is invoked
    forthis custom auth handler.  The object has to be an instance of
    `ZimbraCustomAuth` (or subclasses of it).

.Registering a custom authentication handler
====
[source, java]
----
public class SampleExtensionCustomAuth implements ZimbraExtension {

  public void init() throws ServiceException {
  /*
   * Register to Zimbra's authentication infrastructure
   * custom:sample should be set for domain attribute zimbraAuthMech
   */
   ZimbraCustomAuth.register("sample", new SampleCustomAuth());
  }
...
}
----
====

==== How Custom Authentication Works

When an authentication request comes in and the domain is specified to use custom authentication, the authenticating framework invokes the authenticate method on the `ZimbraCustomAuth` instance passed as the handler parameter to `ZimbraCustomAuth.register()`.

The account object for the principal to be authenticated and the clear-text password entered by the user are passed to `ZimbraCustomAuth.authenticate()`.

All attributes of the account can be retrieved from the account object.

=== Kerberos5 Authentication Mechanism

Kerberos5 Authentication Mechanism authenticates users against an external
Kerberos server.

1.  Set the domain attribute `zimbraAuthMech` to `kerberos5`.
2.  Set the domain attribute `zimbraAuthKerberos5Realm` to the Kerberos5
    realm in which users in this domain are created in the Kerberos
    database.
    When users log in with an email password and the domain,
    `zimbraAuthMech` is set to `kerberos5`, the server constructs the
    Kerberos5 principal by
    `\{localpart-of-the-email}@\{value-of-zimbraAuthKerberos5Realm}` and
    uses that to authenticate to the kerberos5 server.

To specify Kerberos5 for an individual account set the account's
`zimbraForeignPrincipal` as `kerberos5:\{kerberos5-principal}`.  For
example: kerberos5:user1@MYREALM.COM.

== Global Address List

The Global Address List (GAL) is a company directory of users, usually
within the organization itself, that is available to all users of the email
system.  {product-name} uses the company directory to look up user
addresses from within the company.

For each {product-name} domain you can configure GAL to use:

* External LDAP server
* {product-name} internal LDAP server
* Both external LDAP server and {product-name} LDAP in GAL searches

The {product-name} Web Client can search the GAL.  When the user searches
for a name, that name is turned into an LDAP search filter similar to the
following example, where the string `%s` is the name the user is searching
for.

.Searching the GAL
====
[source]
----
(|(cn = %s*)(sn=%s*)(gn=%s*)(mail=%s*))
  (zimbraMailDeliveryAddress = %s*)
  (zimbraMailAlias=%s*)
  (zimbraMailAddress = %s*)
----
====

=== GAL Attributes in {product-name}

The
<<attributes_mapped_to_zimbra_collaboration_contact,Attributes Mapped to {product-name} Contact>>
table maps generic GAL search attributes to their {product-name}
contact fields.

LDAP attributes are mapped to GAL entry fields.  For example, the LDAP
attribute `displayName` and `cn` can be mapped to GAL entry field `fullName`.
The mapping is configured in the `zimbraGalLdapAttrMap` attribute.

[[attributes_mapped_to_zimbra_collaboration_contact]]
.Attributes Mapped to {product-name} Contact
[cols="m,",options="header"]
|===============================================================
|Standard LDAP Attribute |{product-name} Contact Field
|co |workCountry
|company |Company
|givenName/gn |firstName
|sn |lastName
|cn |fullName
|initials |initials
|l |workCity
|street, streetaddress |workStreet
|postalCode |workPostalCode
|telephoneNumber |workPhone
|mobile |mobile
|pager |pager
|facisimileTelephoneNumber |faxNumber
|st |workState
|title |jobTitle
|mail |email
|thumbnailPhoto |thumbnailPhoto
|objectClass |Not currently mapped
|===============================================================

=== {product-name} GAL Search Parameters

GAL is configured on a per-domain basis.  To configure the attributes, you
can run the GAL Configuration Wizard from the Administration Console.

=== Modifying Attributes

Additions, changes and deletions to the GAL attributes are made through the
Zimbra Administration Console or from the `zmprov` commands.

Users can modify attributes for their account in the directory. When users
change their options from the {product-short} {web-client}, they also modify the
attributes when they change their preferences.

== Flushing LDAP Cache

When you modify the following type of entries in the Zimbra LDAP server,
you might need to flush the LDAP cache to make the change available on the
server.

* Themes
* Locales
* Account
* Groups
* COS
* Domains
* Global configuration
* Server
* Zimlet configuration

=== Flush the Cache for Themes and Locales

When you add or change theme (skin) property files and locale resource
files for {product-short} on a server, you must flush the cache to make
the new content available.

.To flush skins:
[source, bash]
----
zmprov flushCache skin
----

.To flush locales
[source, bash]
----
zmprov flushCache locale
----

=== Flush Accounts, Groups, COS, Domains, and Servers

When you modify the account, COS, groups, domain, and server attributes,
the change is effective immediately on the server to which the modification
is done.  On the other servers, the LDAP entries are automatically updated
after a period of time if the attributes are cached.

The default {product-short} setting to update the server is 15 minutes.
The caching period is configured on local config key.

.To change the setting:
[source, bash]
----
zmlocalconfig ldap_cache_<object>_maxage
----

.To enable changes immediately:
[source, bash]
----
zmprov flushCache {account|cos|domain|group|server|...} [name|id]...
----

If you do not specify a name or ID along with the type, all entries in
cache for that type are flushed and the cache is reloaded.

[NOTE]
Some server attributes require a server restart even after the cache is
flushed.  For example, settings like bind port or number of processing
threads.

=== Flush Global Attributes

When you modify global config attributes, the changes are effective
immediately on the server to which the modification is done.  On other
mailbox servers, you must flush the cache to make the changes available or
restart the server.  LDAP entries for global config attributes do not
expire.

Some global config attributes are computed into internal representations
only once per server restart.  For efficiency reasons, changes to those
attributes are not effective until after a server restart, even after the
cache is flushed.  Also, some global configuration settings and server
settings that are inherited from global config are only read once at server
startup, for example port or number of processing threads.  Modifying these
types of attributes requires a server restart.

To flush the cache for global config changes on all servers:

1.  Modify the setting on the local server
+
[source, bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraImapClearTextLoginEnabled TRUE
----
+
The change is performed via the server identified by the localconfig keys
`zimbra_zmprov_default_soap_server` and `zimbra_admin_service_port`.

2.  To flush the global config cache on all other servers, `zmprov flushCache`
must be issued on all servers, one at a time (or use `zmprov flushCache -a`).
+
For example:
+
[source, bash]
----
zmprov –s server2 flushCache config
zmprov –s server3 flushCache config
----

3.  To determine if the action requires a restart
+
[source, bash]
----
zmprov desc -a <attributename>
----
+
The `requiresRestart` value is added to the output if a restart is required.
