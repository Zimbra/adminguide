= Monitoring {product-abbrev} Servers
:toc:

The {product-name} ({product-abbrev}) includes the following to
help you monitor the Zimbra servers, usage, and mail flow:

* Zimbra Logger package to capture and display server statistics and server
status, and to create nightly reports
* Mailbox quota monitoring
* MTA mail queue monitoring
* Log files

Also, selected error messages generate SNMP traps, which can be monitored
using an SNMP tool.

[NOTE]
Checking the overall health of the system as a whole is beyond the scope of
this document.

== Zimbra Logger

The Logger includes tools for syslog aggregation and reporting.  Installing
the Logger is optional, but if you do not install it, server statistics and
server status information are not captured.

In environments with more than one {product-name} server, Logger is
enabled on one mailbox server only.  This server is designated as the
monitor host.  The {product-name} monitor host is responsible for
checking the status of all the other {product-name} servers and
presenting this information on the Zimbra administration console.
Real-time service status, MTA, spam, virus traffic and performance
statistics can be displayed.  The Logger creates a daily report about mail
activity, such as the number of messages, average delivery delay, and
errors generated.

[NOTE]
In a multi-server installation, you must set up the syslog configuration
files on each server to enable Logger to display the server statistics on
the Administration Console, and you must enable the Logger host.  If you
did not configure this when you installed {product-name}, do so now.

=== Enabling Server Statistics

Enable server statistics to show both system- wide and server specific data
about the inbound message volume, inbound message count, anti-spam/anti-virus
activity and disk usage for messages processed in the last 48
hours, 30 days, 60 days, and the last year.

. On each server, as root, type `/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmsyslogsetup`.  This
updates the syslog configuration to enable gathering server statistics.

. On the logger monitor host, you must configure *syslog* to accept
syslog messages from remote machines.
See https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Configuring-Logger-Host for details.

[NOTE]
These steps are not necessary for a single-node installation.

=== Reviewing Server Status

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Monitor*

The *Server Status* page lists all servers and services, their
status, and when the server status was last checked.  The servers include
the MTA, LDAP, and mailbox server.  The services include MTA, LDAP,
Mailbox, SNMP, Anti-Spam, Anti-Virus, Spell checker, and Logger.

To start a server if it is not running, use the `zmcontrol` CLI command.  You
can stop and start services from the Administration Console.

=== Enabling or Disabling Server Services

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Servers -> _server_*

Server services are enabled or disabled from the *Servers -> _server_*
page.  Select *Services* in the Navigation pane and select to enable or
disable services.

=== Viewing Server Performance Statistics

If the Logger package is installed on a Zimbra mailbox server, Server
Statistics shows bar graphs of the message count, message volume,
anti-spam, and anti-virus activity.  The information is displayed for the
last 48 hours, and 30 days, 60 days, and 365 days.

When Server Statistics is selected in the Navigation pane, consolidated
statistics for all mailbox servers is displayed.  Selecting a specific
server in the expanded view shows statistics for that server only.  Server
specific information also includes disk usage, session information, and
mailbox quota details.

The following display system-wide information:

* *Message Count* -- counts message transactions.  A transaction is defined
as either the SMTP receipt of a message per person (by Postfix) or a LMTP
delivery of it (by mailboxd) per person.  For example, if a message is sent
to three people, six transactions are displayed.  Three for SMTP to Postfix
and three for LMTP to mailboxd.  The message count is increased by six.

* *Message Volume* -- displays the aggregate size in bytes of transactions
sentand received per hour and per day.  Graphs show the total inbound data
by volume in bytes.

* *Anti-Spam/Anti-Virus Activity* -- displays the number of messages that
werechecked for spam or viruses and the number of messages that were tagged
as spam or deemed to contain a virus.  The AS/AV count is increased by one
per message scanned.  One message sent to three people counts as only one
message processed by AS/AV.
+
The Message Count and the Anti-spam/Anti-virus Activity graphs display a
different message count because:

** Outbound messages may not go through the Amavisd filter, as the system
architecture might not require outbound messages to be checked.

** Messages are received and checked by Amavisd for spam and viruses before
being delivered to all recipients in the message.  The message count shows
the number of recipients who received messages.

Server-specific statistics also include the following details:

* *Disk* -- for a selected server displays the disk used and the disk
spaceavailable.  The information is displayed for the last hour, day,
month, and year.

* *Session* -- displays information about the active Web client,
administratorand IMAP sessions.  You can see how many active sessions are
opened, who is logged on, when the session was created and the last time
the session was accessed.

* *Mailbox Quota* -- displays information about each account sorted
bymailbox size in descending order.  See
<<monitoring_mailbox_quotas,Monitoring Mailbox Quotas>>.

=== Configuring Logger Mail Reports

The Logger generates a report about mail activity daily at 11:30 p.m. and
sends it to the administrator's email address.

You can configure the number of accounts to include in the report.  The
default is 25 sender and 25 recipient accounts.

* Changing the number of recipients to add to the report:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -e zimbra_mtareport_max_recipients=<number>
----

* Changing the number of senders to add to the report:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -e zimbra_mtareport_max_senders=<number>
----

== Configuring Disk Space Notifications

You should regularly review your disk capacity and when disks are getting
full, take preventative measures to maintain service.  A warning alert
email notification is sent to the administrator account when disk space is
low.  The default is to send a warning alert when the threshold reaches 85%
and a critical alert when the threshold reaches 95%.

You can change these values.  Use `zmlocalconfig` to configure the
disk warning thresholds.

* Warning alerts
+
[source,bash]
----
zmdisklog_warn_threshold
----

* Critical alert:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmdisklog_critical_threshold
----

When starting services with zmcontrol, if the threshold is exceeded, a
warning is displayed before the services are started.  You should clean up
your disk to free up space.

== Monitoring Servers

The {product-name} server collects many performance related
statistics that can help you diagnose problems and load issues.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Monitor > Advanced Statistics*

The *Advanced Statistics* page includes advanced graphing
options that lets you generate various charts based on statistical
information for the CPU, IO, mailboxd, MTA queue, MariaDB and other
components.

To chart the graphics in Advanced Statistics, select one of these groups
and then select from the list of specific counters for the type of
information to display.

The information covers a wide array of data:

* *cpu.csv* -- CPU utilization.  This group contains counters to keep track
ofCPU usage (iowait, idle, system, user, time etc.).  CPU information can
be tracked both at the server level and the process level.

* *df.csv* -- Captures disk usage.  Disk utilization is tracked for each
diskpartition.

* *fd.csv* -- file descriptor count.  Keeps track of system file descriptor
usageover time.  This is primarily used to track down "out-of-file
descriptor" errors.

* *mailboxd.csv* -- {product-name} server and JVM statistics.
Mailboxdstores almost all of its statistics here.  Interesting numbers to
keep track of are heap_used, heap_free, imap_conn, soap_sessions,
pop_conn, db_conn_count.

* *mtaqueue.csv* -- Postfix queue.  This measures the mail queue size
innumber of messages and the size in bytes.

* *proc.csv* -- Process statistics for Zimbra processes.  For example
mailboxd/java, MariaDB, OpenLDAP, etc.)

* *soap.csv* -- SOAP request processing time.

* *threads.csv* -- JVM thread counts.  Counts the number of threads with
acommon name prefix.

* *vm.csv* -- Linux VM statistics (from the vmstat command).

* *io-x.csv* and *io.csv* -- store data from the `iostat(1)` command (`io-x.csv`
with `iostat -x`).

== Configuring Denial of Service Filter Parameters

The denial-of-service filter (DoSFilter) limits exposure to requests
flooding.  The DoSFilter throttles clients sending a large number of
requests over a short period of time.

The DoSFilter is enabled by default on {product-abbrev} and is applied to all requests.
You can modify the configuration to accommodate your specific environmental
needs.  Disabling the DoSFilter is not recommended.

=== Identifying False Positives

Sometimes Zimbra Connector for Outlook (ZCO), mobile ActiveSync clients, or
running some zmprov commands trigger the DoSFilter.  When this happens, the
Zimbra mailbox service is unavailable.  You can review the following logs
to see if the DoSFilter was applied.

* `/opt/zimbra/log/sync.log`.

=== Customizing DoSFilter Configuration

The following attributes are used with zmprov to configure the DoSFilter.
These attributes can be configured as global settings and as server
settings.  If these attributes are set in the server, the server settings
override the global settings.

You can modify these settings, but the default configuration is
recommended.

[cols="2,3a",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Attribute |Description

|*DoSFilter Delay* +
`zimbraHttpDosFilterDelay-Millis` |

The delay given to all requests over the rate limit before they are
considered.  The default is -1.

* -1 = Reject request
* 0 = No delay
* Any other value = Delay is in ms

[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraHttpDosFilterDelayMillis {x}
----

|*DoSFilter Maximum Requests Per Second* +
`zimbraHttpDosFilterMaxRequestsPerSec` |

The maximum number of requests from a connection per second.  Requests in
excess of this are throttled.  The default is 30 and the minimum is 1.

[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraHttpDosFilterMaxRequestsPerSec {x}
----

|*DoSFilter IP Addresses Whitelist* +
`zmprov mcf zimbraHttpThrottleSafeIPs {x.x.x.x,192.168.x.x}` |

IP addresses to ignore when applying the DosFilter.  This attribute does
not have a default value, however the following loopback IPs are
whitelisted by default.

* 127.0.0.1
* ::1

The IP addresses should be comma separated.

[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraHttpThrottleSafeIPs {addresses}
----

|=======================================================================


A mailbox server restart is required after modifying these attributes.
Type:

[source,bash]
----
zmmailboxdctl restart
----

=== Tuning Considerations for {product-abbrev} 8.0.3 and later

* *{product-abbrev} Member Servers* -- {product-abbrev} servers under the control of a single
masterLDAP server are automatically whitelisted by IP address.  These hosts
are discovered using a *GetAllServersRequest*.  Type as `zmprov gas`.

* *External Provisioning Hosts/SOAP API* -- External provisioning hosts can
beadded to the IP whitelist to ensure that the DoSFilter does not block
some requests.  For example, a mailbox reindex might make several calls per
second that can trigger the DoSFilter.

== Working with Mail Queues

When the Zimbra MTA receives mail, it routes the mail through a series of
queues to manage delivery; incoming, active, deferred, held, and corrupt.

The *incoming* message queue holds the new mail that has been received.
Each message is identified with a unique file name.  Messages are moved to
the active queue when there is room.  If there are no problems, message
move through this queue very quickly.

The *active* message queue holds messages that are ready to be sent.  The
MTA sets a limit to the number of messages that can be in the active queue
at any one time.  From here, messages are moved to and from the anti-virus
and anti-spam filters before being delivered to another queue.

Messages that cannot be delivered are placed in the *deferred* queue.  The
reasons for the delivery failures are documented in a file in the deferred
queue.  This queue is scanned frequently to resend the message.  If the
message cannot be sent after the set number of delivery attempts, the
message fails.  The message is bounced back to the original sender.  The
default for the bounce queue lifetime is five days.

The *held* message queue keeps mail that could not be processed.  Messages
stay in this queue until the administrator moves them.  No periodic
delivery attempts are made for messages in the held queue.

The *corrupt* queue stores damaged unreadable messages.

=== Change the Bounce Queue Lifetime

* The MTA server's bounce queue lifetime is set for five days.  To change
the default queue lifetime setting
+
[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -e bounce_queue_lifetime={#}
----

* To permanently have messages bounced back to the sender, instead of being
sent to the deferred queue first
+
[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -e zimbraLmtpPermanentFailureWhenOverQuota=TRUE
----

=== Notifying Senders of Bounced Messages

Before the bounce queue lifetime sends the message back to the sender,
senders can be notified that the message they sent is in the deferred queue
and has not been delivered.

Configure the following attributes to send a warning message to the sender.

* Configure the time after which the sender receives the message headers of
email that is still queued.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -c postfix_delay_warning_time=0h
----

* Configure the recipient of postmaster notifications with the message
headers of mail that the MTA did not deliver.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -c postfix_bounce_notice_recipient=postmaster
----

* Configure the list of error classes that are reported to the postmaster.
+
[source,bash]
----
zmlocalconfig -c postfix_notify_classes=resource,software
----

[NOTE]
See Postfix documentation for details on the impact of changes to these
Postfix attributes.

You can monitor the mail queues for delivery problems from the
Administration Console.

=== Viewing Mail Queues

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Monitor > Mail Queues*

If you are having problems with mail delivery, you can view the mail queues
from the *Mail Queues* page in the Administration Console to see if
you can fix the mail delivery problem.  When you open mail queues, the
content of the deferred, incoming, active, hold, and corrupt queues at that
point in time can be viewed.  You can view the number of messages and where
they are coming from and going to.

For each queue, the Summary pane shows a summary of messages by receiver
domain, origin IP, sender domain, receiver address, sender address, and for
the deferred queue, by error type.  You can select any of the summaries to
see detailed envelope information by message in the Messages pane.

The Messages pane displays individual message envelope information for
search filters selected from the Summary pane.

The following mailbox queue functions can be performed for all the messages
in a queue:

* *Hold* to select a set of messages that you want to hold.  Incoming,
active,deferred, and corrupt messages can be moved to the Held queue.
Messages stay in this queue until the administrator moves them.

* *Release* to remove all message from the Held queue.  Messages aremoved
to the Deferred queue.

* *Requeue* all messages in the queue being viewed.  Requeuing messagescan
be used to send messages that were deferred because of a configuration
problem that has been fixed.  Messages are re-evaluated and earlier
penalties are forgotten.

* *Delete* all messages in the queue being viewed.

The Zimbra MTA, Postfix queue file IDs are reused.  If you requeue or
delete a message, note the message envelope information, not the queue ID.
It is possible that when you refresh the mail queues, the queue ID could be
used on a different message.

=== Flushing Message Queues

You can flush the server of all messages.  When you click Flush on the Mail
Queue toolbar, delivery is immediately attempted for all messages in the
Deferred, Incoming and Active queues.

[[monitoring_mailbox_quotas]]
== Monitoring Mailbox Quotas

Mailbox quotas apply to email messages, attachments, calendar appointments,
and tasks in a user's account.  When an account quota is reached, all mail
messages are rejected.  Users must delete mail from their account to get
below their quota limit - this includes emptying their Trash, or you can
increase their quota.

=== Viewing Quota

You can check mailbox quotas for individual accounts from *Server Statistics*
on the Administration Console.  Mailbox Quota gives you an instant view of
the Mailbox Size and Quota Used information for each account.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Monitor > Server Statistics*

// begin list
. Select the *_server_* for which you want to view statistics.

. In the Navigation pane, select *Mailbox Quota*.  The Mailbox Quota page
displays with the following information:
* Quota column shows the mailbox quota allocated to the account.  Quotas
are configured either in the COS or by account.
* Mailbox Size column shows the disk space used.
* Quota Used column shows what percentage of quota is used.

=== Increase or Decrease Quota

From a COS or Account, you can configure a quota threshold that, when
reached, sends a message alerting users that they are about to reach their
mailbox quota.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Configure > Class of Service -> _COS_ -> Advanced* +
*Home > Manage > Accounts -> _account_ -> Advanced*

// list
. Scroll down to the Quota section.
. Modify the quota settings.
. Click *Save*.

== Viewing MobileSync Statistics

The *MobileSync Statistics* page in the Monitor section in the admin
console displays the number of currently connected ActiveSync devices that
are on the {product-name} system.

== Monitoring Authentication Failures

To protect against dictionary-based and distributed attacks, you can
configure the `zmauditwatch`.  The script attempts to detect more advanced
attacks by looking at where the authentication failures are coming from and
how frequently they are happening for all accounts on a Zimbra mailbox
server and sends an email alert to the administrator's mailbox.

The types of authentication failures checked include:

* *IP/Account hash check* -- The default is to send an email alert if
10authenticating failures from an IP/account combination occur within a 60
second window.

* *Account check* -- The default is to send an email alert if 15
authenticationfailures from any IP address occur within a 60 second window.
This check attempts to detect a distributed hijack based attack on a single
account.

* *IP check* -- The default is to send an email alert if 20 authentication
failuresto any account occur within a 60 second window.  This check
attempts to detect a single host based attack across multiple accounts.

* *Total authentication failure check* -- The default is to send an email
alert if1000 auth failures from any IP address to any account occurs within
60 seconds.  The default should be modified to be 1% of the active accounts
on the mailbox server.

The default values that trigger an email alert are changed in the following
zmlocalconfig parameters:

* IP/Account value, change `zimbra_swatch_ipacct_threshold`
* Account check, change `zimbra_swatch_acct_threshold`
* IP check, change `zimbra_swatch_ip_threshold`
* Total authentication failure check, change
  `zimbra_swatch_total_threshold`

Configure `zimbra_swatch_notice_user` with the email address that should
receive the alerts.

== Viewing Log Files

{product-name} logs its activities and errors to a combination of
system logs through the syslog daemon as well as Zimbra specific logs on
the local file system.  The logs described below are the primary logs that
are used for analysis and troubleshooting.

Local logs containing Zimbra activity are in the `/opt/zimbra/log`
directory.

* *audit.log* -- This log contains authentication activity of users
andadministrators and login failures.  In addition, it logs admin activity
to be able to track configuration changes.

* *clamd.log* -- This log contains activity from the anti-virus application
clamd.

* *freshclam.log* -- This log contains log information related to the
updating ofthe clamd virus definitions.

* *mailbox.log* -- This log is a mailboxd log4j server log containing the
logs from the mailbox server.  This includes the mailbox store, LMTP
server, IMAP and POP servers, and Index server.

* *myslow.log* -- This slow query log consists of all SQL statements from
themailbox server that took more then `long_query_time` seconds to execute.
+
[NOTE]
`long_query_time` is defined in `/opt/zimbra/conf/my.cnf`.

* *spamtrain.log* -- This log contains output from `zmtrainsa` during
regularly scheduled executions from the cron.

* *sync.log* -- This log contains information about {product-name}
mobilesync operations.

Other logs include:

* */opt/zimbra/jetty/logs/* -- This is where Jetty-specific activity is
logged.

* */opt/zimbra/db/data/<hostname>.err* -- This is the message store
database error log.

* */opt/zimbra/logger/db/data/<hostname>.err* -- This is the Logger
database error log.

{product-name} activity logged to System syslog

* */var/log/zimbra.log* -- The Zimbra syslog details the activities of the
ZimbraMTA (Postfix, amavisd, anti-spam, anti-virus), Logger, Authentication
(cyrus-sasl), and Directory (OpenLDAP).  By default LDAP activity is logged
to `zimbra.log`.

=== Syslog

Zimbra modifies the systems syslog daemon to capture data from the mail and
local syslog facility to `/var/log/zimbra.log`.  This allows syslogd to
capture data from several {product-name} components including
Postfix, Amavis, ClamAV, mailboxd, zmconfigd, and logger.  The SNMP module
uses the data from the log file to generate traps for critical errors.  The
zmlogger daemon also collects a subset of the data in this file to provide
statistics on the utilization of {product-name} via the
Administration Console.

By default, mailboxd is configured to log its output to
`/opt/zimbra/log/mailbox.log`.  You can enable mailboxd to take advantage
of a centralizedsyslogd infrastructure by enabling the following either
globally or by server:

[source,bash]
----
zmprov mcf zimbraLogToSysLog TRUE
----

=== Using log4j to Configure Logging

The {product-name} server uses `log4j`, a Java logging package as the
log manager.  By default, the {product-name} server has `log4j`
configured to log to the local file system.  You can configure `log4j` to
direct output to another location.  Go to the
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[Log4j website] for information about
using `log4j`.

{product-abbrev} does not check the log4j changes.  To remove all account loggers and
reloads in `/opt/zimbra/conf/log4j.properties`, use the `zmprov
resetAllLoggers` command.

=== Logging Levels

The default logging level is set to include logs that are generated for
INFO, WARNING, ERROR and FATAL.  When problems start to occur, you can turn
on the DEBUG or TRACE log levels.

To change the logging levels, edit the `log4j` properties,
`log4j.properties`, `log4j.logger.zimbra`.

When enabling DEBUG, you can specify a specific category to debug.  For
example, to see debug details for POP activity, you would type
`logger.zimbra.pop=DEBUG`.

The following categories are predefined in `log4j`:

[cols="2m,3",options="",]
|====================================================
|zimbra.account |Account operations
|zimbra.acl |ACL operations
|zimbra.backup |Backup and restore
|zimbra.cache |Inmemory cache operations

|zimbra.dbconn |Database connection tracing
|zimbra.extensions |Server extension loading
|zimbra.filter |Mail filtering
|zimbra.gal |GAL operations
|zimbra.imap |IMAP protocol operations
|zimbra.index |Index operations
|zimbra.io |Filesystem operations
|zimbra.ldap |LDAP operations
|zimbra.lmtp |LMTP operations (incoming mail)
|zimbra.mailbox |General mailbox operations
|zimbra.misc |Miscellaneous
|zimbra.op |Changes to mailbox state
|zimbra.pop |POP protocol operations
|zimbra.redolog |Redo log operations
|zimbra.security |Security events
|zimbra.session |User session tracking
|zimbra.smtp |SMTP operations (outgoing mail)
|zimbra.soap |SOAP protocol
|zimbra.sqltrace |SQL tracing
|zimbra.store |Mail store disk operations
|zimbra.sync |Sync client operations
|zimbra.system |Startup/shutdown and other system messages
|zimbra.wiki |Wiki operations
|zimbra.zimlet |Zimlet operations
|====================================================

[NOTE]
Changes to the log level take affect immediately.

.Logging Events
[cols="1s,1,1,1,6",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Level |Local? |Syslog |SNMP Trap |When Used

|FATAL |Y |Y |Y |
Designates very severe error events that the application to abort or impact
a large number of users.  For example, being unable to contact the MariaDB
database.

|ERROR |Y |Y |N |
Designates error events that might still allow the application to continue
running or impact a single user.  For example, a single mailbox having a
corrupt index or being unable to delete a message from a mailbox.

|WARN |Y |N |N |
Designates potentially harmful situations but are usually recoverable or
can be ignored.  For example, user log in failed.

|INFO |Y |N |N |
Designates information messages that highlight the progress of the
application, basic transaction-level logging.  For example, server
start-ups, mailbox creation/deletion, account creation.

|DEBUG |Y |N |N |
Events that would generally be useful to help a customer debug problems.

|=======================================================================

(*) A few non-critical messages such, as service startup messages, will
generate traps.

=== Protocol Trace

Protocol trace is available in the following logging categories:
----
zimbra.smtp
zimbra.lmtp
zimbra.soap
zimbra.imap
zimbra.imap-client
zimbra.pop
zimbra.pop-client
----

=== Reviewing mailbox.log Records

The `mailbox.log` file contains every action taken on the mailbox server,
including authentication sessions, LMTP, POP3, and IMAP servers, and Index
server.  Review the `mailbox.log` to find information about the health of
your server and to help identify problems.

`mailbox.log` records valid and invalid login attempts, account activity
such as opening email, deleting items, creating items, indexing of new
mail, server activities including start and stop.  The progress of an
activity on the mail server is logged as INFO.  If the expected results of
the activity fails and errors occurs, an exception is written to the log.

You can set up logging options for a single account in order to trace
account activity for one user without filling up mailbox.log with log
messages for unrelated accounts.  See <<command_line_utilities,Command-Line
Utilities>>, the `zmprov` miscellaneous section.

*Reading records in the log* The example below is a record showing that
on June 25, 2007, the zimbra server with an IP address of 127.0.0.1 was in
the process of deleting backups that were created on Monday, June 18, 2007
at 8 seconds after midnight Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) or older than that
date.

image:images/mailboxlogdescription.png[Mailbox Log Entry]

[NOTE]
*Component thread number* identifies which thread managed by mailboxd is
performing the action logged.

==== Handler Exceptions and Stack Traces

If an error occurs during the progress of an activity, a handler exception
is added to the end of the log record to notify you that an event occurred
during the execution of the process that disrupted the normal flow.  This
signals that some type of error was detected.

.Handler Exception
====
[source,subs="quotes"]
----
007-06-25 00:00:10,379 INFO [btpool0-1064] [name=nriers@example.com;mid=228;ip=10.2.3.4;ua=zimbra Desktop/0.38;] SoapEngine - *handler exception*
----
====

Sometimes a stack trace is displayed after the exceptions notification.  A
stack trace reports the threads and monitors in the zimbra's *mailboxd*
service.  This information aids in debugging, because the trace shows where
the error occurred.  The last few entries in the stack often indicate the
origin of the problem.  When the *caused by* descriptor is included in the
log line, this is the root of the error.  In the example below, the error

==== Mailbox log files

The `mailbox.log` files rotate daily.  The mailbox log files are saved in
`/opt/zimbra/log`.  Previous `mailbox.log` file names include the date the
file was made.  The log without a date is the current log file.  You can
back up and remove these files.

==== Troubleshooting Mail Problems

To review the `mailbox.log` for errors, search for the email address or the
service that is experiencing the problem.  Also, search for WARN or ERROR
log levels, read the text of the message.  When you find the error, review
the records, tracing the events that happened before the problem was
recorded.

==== System Crashing

When your system crashes, locate the startup message and then look for
errors before the startup message date.  This example shows an
out-of-memory error on June 17, 2007.

==== Account Error - Login error

`mailbox.log` logs any successful or unsuccessful login attempts from IMAP,
POP3 or ZWC.  When you are looking for a login error, start by looking for
"Auth."  This example shows that someone from IP address 10.4.5.6 was
trying to log in as admin on the Zimbra Web Client, using Firefox in a
Windows OS.  Permission was denied because it was not an admin account.

== Reading a Message Header

Each email message includes a header that shows the path of an email from
its origin to destination.  This information is used to trace a message's
route when there is a problem with the message.  The Zimbra email message
header can be viewed from the Zimbra Web Client Message view.  Right-click
on a message and select *Show Original*.


The following lines are in the message header:

* *Date* -- The date and time the message was sent.  When you specify time,
you can specify range by adding start and stop time to search for messages.

* *From* -- The name of the sender and the email address

* *To* -- The name of the recipient and the email address.  Indicates
primary recipients.

* *Message-ID* -- Unique number used for tracing mail routing

* *In-Reply-To* -- Message ID of the message that is a reply to.  Used to
linkrelated messages together.

* *Received: from* -- The name and IP address the message was sent from. The
header displays Received: from information from the MTA to the LMTP and
from the local host.

== Fixing Corrupted Mailbox Index

Mail messages and attachments are automatically indexed before messages are
deposited in a mailbox.  Each mailbox has an index file associated with it.
This index file is required to retrieve search results from the mailbox.

If a mailbox's index file becomes corrupt or is accidentally deleted, you
can re-index the messages in the mailbox from the Administration Console.

Text searches on an account might or might not fail with errors when the
index is corrupt.  You cannot count on a user reporting a failed text
search to identify that the index is corrupt.  You must monitor the index
log for messages about corrupt indexes.  If the server detects a corrupt
index, a message is logged to the Zimbra mailbox.log at the WARN logging
level.  The message starts with *Possibly corrupt index*.  When this
message is displayed, the administratormust correct the problem.  In many
cases correcting the problem might mean reindexing the mailbox.

Reindexing a mailbox's content can take some time, depending on the number
of messages in the mailbox.  Users can still access their mailbox while
reindexing is running, but because searches cannot return results for
messages that are not indexed, searches may not find all results.

=== Checking for Index Corruption

Run a sanity check on a specific mailbox index using the `zmprov
verifyIndex` command.

[source,bash]
----
zmprov verifyIndex <user@example.com>
----

If problems are detected, a failure status is returned and a repair can
be performed on the index.

=== Repairing and Reindexing a Corrupt Index

Use the `reIndexMailbox` command to repair and reindex a corrupt index.

[source,bash]
----
zmprov reIndexMailbox <user@example.com> start
----

This returns a status of _started_.

== SNMP Monitoring and Configuration

=== SNMP Monitoring Tools

You will probably want to implement server monitoring software in order to
monitor system logs, CPU and disk usage, and other runtime information.

{product-name} uses swatch to watch the syslog output to generate
SNMP traps.

=== SNMP Configuration

{product-name} includes an installer package with SNMP monitoring.
This package should be run on every server ({product-name}, OpenLDAP,
and Postfix) that is part of the {product-name} configuration.

The only SNMP configuration is the destination host to which traps should
be sent.

=== Errors Generating SNMP Traps

The {product-name} error message generates SNMP traps when a service
is stopped or is started.  You can capture these messages using third-party
SNMP monitoring software and direct selected messages to a pager or other
alert system.

== Checking MariaDB

The MariaDB database is automatically checked weekly to verify the health
of the database.  This check takes about an hour.  If any errors are found,
a report is sent to the administrator's account.  The report name that runs
the MariaDB check is *zmbintegrityreport,* and the crontab is automatically
configured to run this report once a week.

[NOTE]
When the MariaDB database is checked, running this report can consume a
significant amount of I/O.  This should not present a problem, but if you
find that running this report does affect your operation, you can change
the frequency with which zmbintegrityreport is run.  See
<<zcs_crontab_jobs,{product-abbrev} Contrab Jobs>>.

== Checking for {product-name} Software Updates

When {product-name} is installed, the {product-name} software update
utility is automatically configured to check for the latest {product-name}
version once a day and if there is an update, to send notification to the
address that is configured in the Administration Console's *Server
Updates*.

The dates and times {product-name} checked for updates is saved to the
*Updates* tab and an email notification is sent out until you update the
{product-abbrev} version.  If you do not want to receive an email
notification of updates, disable *Send notification email when updates are
available*.

You can configure the following:

* *Server that checks for updates* -- Available servers are listed and only
one server is configured.  The selected server checks for updates and the
result of the update response from www.zimbra.com is stored in LDAP.

* *Check for updates every x* -- The default is to check once a day.  You
can change the frequency interval to check every x hours, minutes, or
seconds.  A cron job is configured to check for new updates.  If the
frequency interval is less than 2 hours, the crontab file must be modified.

* *Updates URL* -- This address is the URL that the server connects to
when checking for updates.  When a {product-name} server checks for
updates, it transmits its version, platform, and build number to Zimbra.
Normally, this URL is not changed.

* To be notified of updates, check the *Send notification email when
updates are available* and enter the send to and send from addresses.  The
default address is the administrator's address.

* A generic email is created.  The subject and content of the email can be
changed.

* When a server polls the URL specified, the response is displayed.

== Updating Zimbra Connector for Microsoft Outlook

The Zimbra Connector for Microsoft Outlook (ZCO) msi file is available from
the Zimbra Utilities Downloads page on the Administration Console.  When a
newer version of ZCO is released before a new version of {product-abbrev}, you can
upload the newer ZCO msi file to the {product-abbrev} server from the Administration
Console.  The file is uploaded to the
`/opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/downloads` directory.

Admin Console: ::
*Home > Tools and Migration > Client Upload*

. Download the new ZCO file to a computer that you can access from
*Client Upload* in the Administration Console

. Click *Browse* to locate the ZCO file to upload.

. Restart {product-abbrev}:
+
[source,bash]
----
zmcontrol restart
----
+
or run
+
[source,bash]
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmupdatedownload
----

The `downloads/index.html` file is updated with the latest ZCO client
version.  This new file can be downloaded from the ZCO link on the
Administration Console *Home > Tools and Migration > Download* page.

[NOTE]
If you do not restart the server, the ZCO download link on the Zimbra
Utilities Download page does not select the newer version to download.

== Notifications and Alerts Sent by {product-name}
