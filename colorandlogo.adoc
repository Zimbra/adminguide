= Color and Logo Management
:toc:

You can change the logo and base colors of the Zimbra Web Client themes
without having to customize individual {product-name} themes.  This
can be done from the administration console or the CLI.

With Touch Client, you can change the logo but modification to theme colors
is not currently supported.

== Changing Theme Color and Logos on the Zimbra Web Client

Base colors for themes, and custom logos can be configured as a global
setting or as a domain setting.

* When the global settings are changed, the changes apply to themes on all
servers.

* When the domain settings are changed, the base color and logos for themes
on the domain are changed.

If global settings and domain-level settings for theme base colors or logos
are not identical, the domain values are displayed for the domain.

[IMPORTANT]
If the logo and base colors are customized in multi-domain {product-name}
environments, you must set a virtual host as the base color: logo
attributes are displayed based on the Host header sent by the browser.

[NOTE]
Various Zimbra themes are included with {product-name}.  Some of
these themes - such as lemongrass, Hot Rod, and Waves - have been designed
with graphics or color codes that do not change when you modify the base
color.  You might want to disable those themes from user’s Theme
preferences selection.

=== Customizing Base Theme Colors

The following base colors in Zimbra Web Client themes can be changed:

* The primary background color displayed in the client.
+
This color is the background of the page. Variants of the color are used
for buttons, background color of the Content and panes, tabs, and
selection highlight. In the following image, the background color
displays with the logo, the variant of the background color displays in
the login area.
* The secondary color is the color used for the toolbar.
* The selection color is the color displayed for a selected item such as
a message or an item in the Overview pane.
* The foreground color is the text color displayed. The default text
color is black. The text color usually does not need to be changed.

Web Client and the {product-name} administration console. The
dimension of the graphic must be exactly 300 x 30.

headers in the pane.

to discard your settings.

*Changing base colors for themes*

Before you begin, identify the six-digit hexadecimal base color values
for the various elements you are changing. You will be using these in
your command entries.

*CLI:* Global Setting:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov modifyConfig <attribute-name> [“#HEX_6digit_colorcode”]
----

*CLI:* Domain Setting:
[source,bash]
----
zmprov modifyDomain <domain> <attribute-name> [“#HEX_6digit_colorcode”]
----

*Modifying a domain*

The example in this section demonstrates how to change to the following
base colors:

* Background color = Coral, #FF7F50
* Secondary color = turquoise, #ADEAEA
* Selection color = yellow, #FFFF00

1. Specify the skin colors:
*CLI:* Log in as a Zimbra user and use parameters to modify the domain:
+
  zmprov modifyDomain domainexample.com zimbraSkinBackgroundColor "#FF7F50" zimbraSkinSecondaryColor "#ADEAEA" zimbraSkinSelectionColor "#FFFF00"
+
The quote marks, "", are required so the use of the # sign does not
comment out the text that follows.
+
2. Use the zmmailboxdctl command to apply the changes by restarting
the mailbox server process:
+
  zmmailboxdctl restart
+
Reload the web client and {product-name} themes for that domain should
now display these colors.
