About this document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document is written for system administrators, and it aims to provide both an
in-depth view of the product architecture to simplify
troubleshooting and the knowledge necessary for solid customizations.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Zimbra Chat is included in Zimbra starting in version 8.7.6 as Beta
software and version 8.8.0 as Stable. Zimbra Chat provides simple and
direct text-only chat between Zimbra accounts. It is
composed of a Zimlet and a Zimbra extension.

The Zimbra extension exposes an XMPP client so users can chat from
a standard XMPP client instead of using the Zimlet
through the Zimbra Web Client. Users can use both methods simultaneously.

[[general-architecture]]
General Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Zimbra Chat is designed for Zimbra. It runs as a Zimbra Server
Extension that implements an XMPP server and handles all the events
shared between the clients. The Zimbra Chat Server Extension uses
both XMPP and a custom protocol to communicate with the Chat Zimlet.

The server extension can handle multiple sessions for a single user,
without limits. Each session has its own delivery queue to ensure
that each session has exactly all of the events as any other
session of the user.

Sessions are not limited by type (XMPP or Chat Zimlet). A user can
use both the Zimbra Web Client and an XMPP client at the same time,
without worrying about interferences between the sessions.

[[components]]
Components
^^^^^^^^^^

Zimbra Chat is compose of two parts:

* Chat Zimlet
* Chat Extension

The Zimbra Chat Extension does not require the Chat Zimlet to
work properly. The Chat Zimlet is designed and built to work only
with the Zimbra Chat Extension.

[[zimlet]]
Zimlet
++++++

The Chat Zimlet is the client component of Chat. It runs on
the Zimbra Web Client and is managed like any other Zimlet. It is fully
integrated in the Zimbra Web Client and uses the same graphics
libraries. The Zimlet can work only with the Chat Extension because the Zimlet
and Extension use a specific protocol to send and receive events. The
Chat Zimlet is supported on all browsers and versions
supported for the Zimbra Web Client.

Features:

* Zimbra Web Client integration.
* Manage the buddy list. Users can add, edit and remove buddies from the
buddy list.
* Open each `chat room' in a separate panel.
* Manage personal status.
* Send/Receive plain messages from users in the buddy list.
* Send presence status to users in the buddy list.
* View presence status of users in the buddy list.
* Support for Emojis (emoticons) on conversations. Emojis are provided
free by EmojiOne http://emojione.com/.
* Send an entire conversation as email.
* Search conversations in the chat history (if enabled in the Extension
options, see <<sect:confkeys>>).
* Get desktop notifications for any incoming message.

[[extension]]
Extension
+++++++++

The Zimbra Chat Extension is the core of Zimbra Chat. It is a complete
chat server that manages the events between connected clients.

It uses the ZAL to integrate into the mailboxd service of Zimbra.

The Extension can handle two types of connections:

* SOAP connections incoming from the Chat Zimlet, using Zimbra’s
SOAP infrastructure.
* XMPP connections from compatible clients.

Features:

* Handle events from multiple sessions.
* Handle SOAP connections for Chat Zimlet clients.
* Handle XMPP (plain and SSL) connections for compatible clients
through a public port (see <<sect:confkeys>>)
* Store the chat history for each conversation in a dedicated `chat'
folder in the user's mailbox (if enabled, see <<sect:confkeys>>).
* Store the relationships between users in the Zimbra database.

[[installation]]
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

installation to install it.

[[upgrade]]
Upgrade
~~~~~~~

Zimbra Chat is upgraded with the rest of the Zimbra platform.

No dedicated upgrade steps are needed.

[[troubleshooting]]
Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This chapter helps the administrator find and solve any
issues. If no solution is found, the administrator is guided through the process to
report the issue.

[[looking-for-errors]]
Looking for Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This process is fundamental to locating the source of an issue and
to find a solution or to correctly report it.

[[sect:zim-err]]
Chat Zimlet Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To locate errors in the source code of the Chat Zimlet, enable developer
mode on the Zimbra Web Client by modifying the URL of the
Zimbra installation, appending `?dev=1` into the browser URL. Adding the
`dev=1` parameter to the URL forces Zimbra to load the entire Web
Client with all not minified sources, included the Zimlets. A longer
load time should be expected.

During the loading of the Zimbra Web Client, open the browser developer
tools.

In the browser developer tools console you will see logs from the
Chat Zimlet. If an error occurs, it will be printed into the console.

If no errors are printed, but you see an unwanted behavior, enable the
`break on exception` option in the developer tools. With that option
enabled, if an error occurs, the execution of the software will be paused on the
line where the error is generated.

If an error occurs, please escalate the issue by sending the file, the row and any
details about the error through the appropriate channels.

If no errors are detected, please see the "Chat Extension Error" section.

[[sect:ext-err]]
Chat Extension Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any exception thrown by the Chat Extension is written into the
`mailbox.log`. To check if there are any exceptions, please refer to
the appropriate section of this guide.

If you can’t find a solution for the exception in the FAQ,
please report the issue through the appropriate channels, including the complete
exception information.

[[sect:tools]]
Tools
~~~~~

[[google-chrome-developer-tools]]
Google Chrome Developer Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the user is experiencing unexpected Zimlet behavior in
the Zimbra Web Client, use Google Chrome Developer Tools
to figure out the source of the issue.

To open the Google Chrome Developer Tools:
* Open the main menu.
* Find the `Other tools` menu option.
* Select `Developer Tools`.

A new panel with many tabs should appear. These tabs are:

* Console:: Like the server console, this tab will display some log information
  and allow you to interact with the JS Runtime.
* Network:: This tab will show any network activity, and it can be used to identify the
  requests to the mailbox and the responses from it.

[[firefox-developer-tools]]
Firefox Developer Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To open the Firefox Developer Tools, open the
main menu and click the `Developer Tools` button.

A new panel with many tabs should appear. These tabs are:

* Console:: Like the server console, this tab will display some log information
  and you allow to interact with the JS Runtime.
* Network:: This tab will show any network activity, and it can be used to identify the
  requests to the mailbox and the responses from it.

[[Chat-zimlet-issues]]
Chat Zimlet Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*The Chat Zimlet is not working after the user login, and I see some
JavaScript Errors. What can I do?*

This is most commonly caused by caching issues. Refresh all the caches with
these commands:

-------------------------------------------------
# As zimbra
zmprov flushCache -a zimlet com_zextras_chat_open

-------------------------------------------------

If the problem persists, escalate the issue.

*The Chat Zimlet doesn’t start at login, and a popup appears informing
the user that the server is not available. What can I do?*

TIP: Remember that the Chat Zimlet will not start if the logged user is using the delegated access feature (e.g. View Mail button
from the admin console) to protect the privacy of the user.

Check to see if the Chat Extension is loaded correctly in the `mailbox.log`
(see the appropriate section of this guide about how to read the `mailbox.log`).

Loading of the Zimbra Extension is granted by the following lines at
the mailbbox startup:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
xxxx-xx-xx xx:xx:xx,xxx INFO  [main] [] mailbox - OpenChat starting ...
xxxx-xx-xx xx:xx:xx,xxx INFO  [main] [] extensions - OpenChat started

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If the problem persists, report the issue, including the exception in the report.

*Another Zimlet is using the sidebar, and a user cannot see the
Chat buddy list. What can I do?*

The Chat Zimlet uses a container that can be used by other Zimlets. To
avoid collisions, try to detect if that container is
used or not.

The Chat Zimlet uses an internal `black list` to detect incompatible
Zimlets and disable the sidebar mode, switching to the docked mode.

The detection may fail if the Zimlet using the sidebar
container is not indexed in the internal blacklist.

If the problem persists, report the issue, mentioning the
name of the conflicting Zimlet.

If a user is stuck in the sidebar mode and another Zimlet has taken
control of the siedebar, you can reset the Zimlet user setting to use the
docked mode with these commands:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# As zimbra
# Reset the involved zimlet user preference:
zmprov modifyAccount user@example.com \
    -zimbraZimletUserProperties "com_zextras_chat_open:zxchat_pref_dockmode:FALSE"
zmprov modifyAccount user@example.com \
    -zimbraZimletUserProperties "com_zextras_chat_open:zxchat_pref_dockmode:TRUE"
# Set the zimlet user preference to dock mode:
zmprov modifyAccount user@example.com \
    +zimbraZimletUserProperties "com_zextras_chat_open:zxchat_pref_dockmode:TRUE"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then reload the Zimbra Web Client to apply the modifications.

If the problem persists, report the issue.

[[Chat-extension-issues]]
Chat Extension Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Server to server messages are not delivered between the two servers. What
can I do?*

This issue can be caused by connection issues between two mailboxes.
Verify that the port `5269` is opened on each server and that the servers can
connect to each other.

To verify if the port is opened on the server, a simple check
can be done by trying to connect to port `5269` using a telnet client.

If everything seems to work properly, open the `mailbox.log` on both servers and
try to send an event (e.g. a text message). If an
exception appears, see if it provides a hint on the error. If there is no
meaningful exception, report the issue and include the exception in the report.

[[sect:how-to-escalate-an-issue]]
How to Escalate an Issue

[[sect:sizing]]
Sizing
^^^^^^

Stress tests are being performed on Zimbra Chat.

We have noticed an increment of the workload stimabe at most 7% in an
Zimbra installation with 20000 users.

The history feature of the Zimbra Chat Extension has the most impact. When
a message is sent, a mime message is either
created or updated, meaning few kilobytes are read or written and some
database queries are performed.

TIP: We suggest disabling history in very large deployments. To edit the
configuration see <<sect:confkeys>>.
