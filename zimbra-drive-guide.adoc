Overview
~~~~~~~~

[[general_architecture]]
General Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The purpose of Zimbra Drive is to connect the Zimbra end user to a
cloud service, external to Zimbra.

Zimbra Drive has three parts: Zimbra Extension, Zimlet and
Cloud App. These parts integrate external storage services and
an authentication mechanism into the Zimbra
Web Interface. Each Zimbra account will be linked to the external storage
service account.

Components
^^^^^^^^^^

Zimbra Drive includes the following components:

1.  Zimbra Drive Extension
2.  Zimlet
3.  Cloud App

Each component is mandatory and requires careful configuration.
However, errors in installation or configuration won’t affect Zimbra
usability.

Extension
^^^^^^^^^

The Zimbra Drive extension is installed in the mailboxd component. The extension
acts between the Zimbra Drive Zimlet and the Cloud App,
providing services like authentication and item actions to the Zimlet.

Zimlet
^^^^^^

The Zimbra Drive Zimlet adds a new _Drive_ tab to the user Zimbra interface, before
the Preferences tab. With the Zimlet, user can search in the linked cloud. +
The Zimlet component is contained in the package `com_zextras_drive_open.zip`.
The Zimlet name is `_com_zextras_drive_open_`.

[[supportedClouds]]
Cloud App
^^^^^^^^^

The external services of cloud storage need a specific app with a dedicated
API to communicate with the Zimbra Drive Extension. Zimbra Drive provides an
app for each of the services supported.

[[nextcloudowncloud]]
Nextcloud/ownCloud
++++++++++++++++++

The Nextcloud/ownCloud app is a specific application for Nextcloud and
ownCloud. It provides transparent authentication in ownCloud and
Nextcloud using Zimbra credentials and a layer of compatibility that
abstracts the version of ownCloud and Nextcloud for the extension.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This chapter guides the administrator through the manual installation of Zimbra Drive.

[[requirements]]
Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Root-level access to the underlying operating system.
* Administrative access to an external cloud supported service (see
[==subsec:supportedClouds==]). +
Supported versions:
** Nextcloud 9, 10, 11
** ownCloud 9.0, 9.1, 10

[[zimbra-packages-installation]]
Zimbra Packages Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes how to install the Zimbra Drive Extension
and the Zimbra Drive Zimlet.

Both the Zimbra Drive Extension and the Zimlet are installed through the official Zimbra
installer. The Zimbra installer prompts you as follows:

....
Use Zimbra's package repository [Y] Yes
...
Install zimbra-drive [Y] Yes
....

[[zimbra-already-installed]]
Zimbra Already Installed
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Zimbra installation adds the Zimbra repositories to apt sources
list, so Zimbra Drive can be installed through the following command:

....
# As root, when apt-get is available
apt-get update
apt-get install zimbra-drive
# As root, when yum is available
yum update
yum install zimbra-drive
....

Hereafter, the Zimbra Drive Extension will be enabled with the zimlet deploy
command and a mailbox restart:

....
# As zimbra
zmzimletctl deploy /opt/zimbra/zimlets/com_zextras_drive_open.zip
zmmailboxd  restart
....

[[cloud-app-installation]]
Cloud App Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are the steps to install the Zimbra Drive Cloud App to the
specific supported cloud.

The cloud services currently supported are Nextcloud and ownCloud with
the archive `zimbradrive.tar.gz`.

[[==subsec:NextcloudownCloudInstallation==]]
Nextcloud/ownCloud
++++++++++++++++++


Nextcloud and ownCloud require the same following installation steps. +
The placeholder `PATHTOCLOUD` is the path of the Nextcloud/ownCloud
service in server:

1.  Copy `zimbradrive.tar.gz` in Nextcloud/ownCloud drive: +
`scp zimbradrive.tar.gz root@cloud:/tmp`
2.  In Nextcloud/ownCloud server, extract `zimbradrive.tar.gz` in
`PATHTOCLOUD/apps`: +
`tar -xvzf zimbradrive.tar.gz -C PATHTOCLOUD/apps`
3.  Change permissions of the extracted folder
`PATHTOCLOUD/apps/zimbradrive` with the user owner of Nextcloud/ownCloud
(E.g.: www-data): +
`chown -R www-data:www-data PATHTOCLOUD/apps/zimbradrive/`
4.  Enable Zimbra Drive App from Nextcloud/ownCloud Admin Interface or
with command:
`sudo -u www-data php PATHTOCLOUD/occ app:enable zimbradrive`

At this point, the Nextcloud/ownCloud Zimbra Drive App is installed and
requires configuration.

On Apache Web Server, Zimbra Drive doesn’t work if the server is not
correctly configured. Refer to these instructions for _Apache Web Server
Configuration_ in the Nextcloud manual
https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/11/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#apache-web-server-configuration[Nextcloud
installation] or in the ownCloud manual
https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#apache-web-server-configuration[ownCloud
installation].

[[configuration]]
Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zimbra Drive configuration is split into the Zimbra side and the Cloud side.
The Zimbra Drive Zimlet doesn’t need more than standard Zimlet
configuration, so the Zimbra side requires only Zimbra Drive
Extension configuration. On the Cloud side, each supported cloud service
configuration will be shown later. These are independent, and you need
only configure for your desired cloud service.

[[zimbra-extension-configuration]]
Zimbra Extension Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Zimbra Extension setup requires the URL of the cloud service that will
be paired. This URL has to be set in the domain attribute
`zimbraDriveOwnCloudURL`, and it is common to all users belonging the same
domain. Different domains may have different cloud service URLs. +
The command to set the cloud service URL is:

....
# As zimbra
zmprov md domainExample.com zimbraDriveOwnCloudURL CLOUD_URL

....

The cloud service URL (`CLOUD_URL`) has to be in the form:
`protocol://cloudHost/path`.

* `protocol`: can be `http` or `https`
* `cloudHost`: hostname of the server with the cloud service
* `path`: path in server of the targeted cloud service

Each cloud service has its entry point. +
In Nextcloud/ownCloud, the URL has to target `index.php`
`protocol://cloudHost/path/index.php`

[[cloud-app-configuration]]
Cloud App Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[NextcloudownCloudInstallation]]
Nextcloud/ownCloud
++++++++++++++++++


When everything is correctly configured, the Zimbra end user creates a
private account in the cloud service that will be paired with the Zimbra
user account. This new cloud account inherits the Zimbra user credentials
and appears in the user's list of Nextcloud/ownCloud interface; however
this account is not active until the Zimbra Drive app is enabled.

Nextcloud and ownCloud have the same following configuration entries. In the
Nextcloud/ownCloud administration panel, it must appear as a new ``Zimbra
Drive`` entry in the left sidebar that redirect to the configuration
view. There are the following configurations:

* (CheckBox) *Enable Zimbra authentication back end* +
(Mandatory checked) On check, adds a configuration in config.php that lets
Nextcloud/ownCloud use Zimbra Drive App class. On uncheck, removes this
configuration.
* (CheckBox) *Allow Zimbra’s users to log in* +
(Mandatory checked) Allows Zimbra users to use Nextcloud/ownCloud with
their Zimbra credentials.
* (InputField) *Zimbra Server* +
(Mandatory) Zimbra webmail host or ip.
* (InputField) *Zimbra Port* +
(Mandatory) Zimbra webmail port.
* (CheckBox) *Use SSL* +
Check if the Zimbra webmail port uses SSL certification.
* (CheckBox) *Enable certification verification* +
Disable only if Zimbra has an untrusted certificate.
* (InputField) *Domain Preauth Key* +
After the Zimbra end user creates a private account with the first
successful access in Zimbra Drive, he can log into the Nextcloud/ownCloud web
interface using Zimbra credentials. In the Nextcloud/ownCloud web
interface, he will find a Zimbra icon in the Apps menu that opens a new
Zimbra webmail tab without a login step. +
This feature works only if the Zimbra Domain PreAuth Key is copied. In
Zimbra, run the following command to show the desired Zimbra
Domain PreAuth Key: +
`# As zimbra` +
`zmprov getDomain example.com zimbraPreAuthKey` +
`# If response is empty, generate with` +
`zmprov generateDomainPreAuthKey domainExample.com` +

Upgrade
~~~~~~~

This chapter guides administrators through the manual upgrade of
Zimbra Drive. It’s important to pay attention to the version of each
component: the compatibility is granted only if each component has the
same version. +
The Zimbra Drive Zimlet and extension  can be upgraded a with Zimbra upgrade,
but the Zimbra Drive App must be manually updated.

[[zimbra-extension-and-zimlet-upgrade]]
Zimbra Extension and Zimlet Upgrade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When Zimbra is upgraded, Zimbra Drive can be
installed directly from the installation. Zimbra Drive can be kept
upgraded in the same Zimbra major.minor versions with apt-get or yum:

....
# As root, when apt-get is available
apt-get update; apt-get install zimbra-drive
# As root, when yum is available
yum update; yum install zimbra-drive
....

[[cloud-app-upgrade]]
Cloud App Upgrade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike the Zimbra Drive Zimlet and the Extension, the Zimbra Drive Cloud app has to be
manually upgraded on every version change.

The upgrade of Zimbra Drive App in Nextcloud/ownCloud requires that
files are replaced. Perform these steps at
installation([==subsec:NextcloudownCloudInstallation==]):

1.  Copy `zimbradrive.tar.gz` in Nextcloud/ownCloud drive +
`scp zimbradrive.tar.gz root@cloud:/tmp`
2.  In the Nextcloud/ownCloud server, extract `zimbradrive.tar.gz` in
`PATHTOCLOUD/apps`: +
`tar -xvzf zimbradrive.tar.gz -C PATHTOCLOUD/apps/apps`
3.  Change permissions of the extracted folder
`PATHTOCLOUD/apps/zimbradrive` with the user owner of Nextcloud/ownCloud
(E.g.: www-data): +
`chown -R www-data:www-data PATHTOCLOUD/apps/zimbradrive/`

On ugrade from version 0.0.1, remove the table oc_zimbradrive_users that
are no longer used. In mysql, execute the following command: +
`DROP TABLE oc_zimbradrive_users;`

[[uninstallation]]
Uninstallation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This chapter guides the administrator through the manual
uninstallation of Zimbra Drive and cleanup of the system.

[[disablePackages]]
Disable Zimbra Drive Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since the Zimbra Drive Extension and the Zimbra Drive Zimlet are installed as
Zimbra packages, their uninstallation is unexpected. To disable Zimbra Drive,
disable the Zimbra Drive Zimlet from the desired user, domain or class of service.

[[remove-cloud-app]]
Remove Cloud App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[NextcloudownCloudUninstallation]]
Nextcloud/ownCloud
++++++++++++++++++

The removal of the Nextcloud/ownCloud App has two steps:
clean up and app uninstall.

The clean up step deletes all Zimbra users' data from
Nextcloud/ownCloud and is not reversible. It *requires* that Zimbra
Drive is installed and enabled. +
However, this clean up step can be skipped. The Zimbra Drive App can be
uninstalled without removing the Zimbra users' data.

*Clean Up*

Before starting clean up, it’s recommended to disable Zimbra users'
access: the configuration *Allow Zimbra’s users to log in* should be
unchecked.

The following commands delete the users created by the Zimbra Drive App and
clean up the table containing references to Zimbra users (replace correctly
`mysql_pwd` and `occ_db`):

....
cd /var/www/cloud           # Go to the OCC path
mysql_pwd='password'        # database password
occ_db='cloud'              # database name for the Nextcloud / ownCloud

# In ownCloud
user_id_column='user_id'    # column name in table oc_accounts of ownCloud
# In Nextcloud
user_id_column='uid'        # column name in table oc_accounts of Nextcloud

mysql -u root --password="${mysql_pwd}" "${occ_db}" -N -s \
    -e 'SELECT uid FROM oc_group_user WHERE gid = "zimbra"' \
    | while read uid; do \
        sudo -u www-data php ./occ user:delete "${uid}"; \
        mysql -u root --password="${mysql_pwd}" "${occ_db}" \
            -e "DELETE FROM oc_accounts WHERE ${user_id_column} = '${uid}' LIMIT 1"; \
      done
....

*App Uninstall*

The Zimbra Drive App can be removed from the Nextcloud/ownCloud Admin
Interface. The configuration should be restored by unchecking
*Enable Zimbra authentication back end*, then the Zimbra
Drive App must be disabled from the ``Enabled Apps'' tab and uninstalled
from the ``Disabled Apps``.

With the previous steps, the Zimbra Drive App folder
(`PATHTOCLOUD/apps/zimbradrive`) is deleted but all the users' files
still remain in the cloud service drive: any configuration or file that
was not previously cleaned up is retrieved on reinstallation of the
Zimbra Drive App.

Advanced Topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[build-from-sources]]
Build from Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the steps to build the Zimbra Drive components. The
official Zimbra Drive source repository is hosted on
https://github.com/ZeXtras/zimbra-drive[GitHub.com/ZeXtras/zimbra-drive].

The build system uses a relative path. The following example assumes that
the working path is `/tmp/`, but it can be changed at will.

....
# Clean the folder that will be used for the build
rm -rf /tmp/ZimbraDrive && cd /tmp/

# Clone the source repository
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ZeXtras/ZimbraDrive.git

# Jump into the source folder
cd ZimbraDrive

# Checkout the correct branch for the Zimbra release (assuming Zimbra 8.8.0 )
git checkout release/8.8.0

# Build the whole package, setting the target Zimbra (can take some minutes)
make clean && make ZAL_ZIMBRA_VERSION=8.8.0
....

The final artifact `zimbra_drive.tgz` will be placed in the folder
`/tmp/zimbradrive/dist`.

The `dist` folder:

The archive zimbra_drive.tgz contains all components of Zimbra Drive:

[[manual-installation]]
Manual Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Manual installation is not supported.

The Zimbra Drive Zimlet and the Extension are installed during the Zimbra
installation. Any modification to the installed Zimbra packages may lead
to a fail during the Zimbra upgrade.

[[extension-1]]
Extension
+++++++++

The files `zimbradrive-extension.jar` and `zal.jar` must be copied in the
right place; then a mailbox restart is required to load the extension.

....
# As root
mkdir -p /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive
cp zimbradrive-extension.jar /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/
cp zal.jar /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/

# As zimbra
mailboxdctl restart

....

Everything is successfully done only if the extension starts correctly. The
following string should be logged in `ZIMBRA_HOME/log/mailbox.log`
at the moment of the last mailbox restart:

....
Initialized extension Zimbra Abstraction Layer for: zimbradrive

....

[[zimlet-1]]
Zimlet
++++++

Deploy the Zimbra Drive Zimlet with the following command:

....
# As zimbra
zmzimletctl deploy com_zextras_drive_open.zip

....

By default, the Zimlet is enabled for the ‘default‘ COS. The Zimlet can
be enabled on any required COS from the administration console.

[[manual-upgrade]]
Manual Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manual upgrade is not supported.

The Zimbra Drive Zimlet and the Extension are upgraded during the the Zimbra
upgrade. Any modification to the installed Zimbra packages may lead to a
fail during the Zimbra upgrade.

[[extension-2]]
Extension
^^^^^^^^^

The Zimbra Drive Extension can be upgraded replacing the
`zimbra-extension.jar` and `zal.jar` files in
`/opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/` and performing a mailbox restart.

....
# As root
cp zimbradrive-extension.jar /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/
cp zal.jar /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/

# As zimbra
mailboxdctl restart
....

[[zimlet-2]]
Zimlet
^^^^^^

The Zimbra Drive Zimlet can be upgraded by deploying the newest version and
flushing cache:

....
# As zimbra
zmzimletctl deploy com_zextras_drive_open.zip
zmprov fc zimlet
....

[[manual-uninstall]]
Manual Uninstall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Manual uninstallation is not supported.

Please consider disabling Zimbra Drive (see:
[==sec:disablePackages==]) instead of uninstalling it. Any modification
to the installed Zimbra packages may lead to a fail during the Zimbra
upgrade.

The manual uninstallation process of the Zimbra Drive Zimlet and the Zimbra
Drive extension requires you to undeploy the Zimlet and clean the extension folder
from zimbra.

To remove the Zimbra Drive Zimlet:

....
# As zimbra
zmzimletctl undeploy com_zextras_drive_open
....

To remove the Zimbra Drive extension:

....
# As root
rm -rf /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/

# As zimbra
zmmailboxdctl restart
....

The last, but not necessary, step is to clean the domain attribute with
the command +
`zmprov md domainExample.com zimbraDriveOwnCloudURL `
